In the high-wire, PSA-style skit titled ‘Tourette’s,’ a host of celebrities, including J.K. Rowling, Mel Gibson, The Real Housewives of New York star Jill Zarin , Armie Hammer , Louis C.K., Bill Cosby and Ye claim they suffer from Tourette’s, which would explain problematic comments or actions they have been involved in.

Harkening back to the BAFTA controversy, SNL ‘s mock Tourette’s PSA was “brought to you by National Workforce of Rethinking Disabilities, or N.W.O.R.D.” At last weekend’s BAFTA ceremony, Davidson shouted the N-word at presenters Delroy Lindo and Michael B. Jordan, along with other offensive language earlier at the event. The ceremony’s host Alan Cumming apologized for the “strong language,” noting that it was a result of “involuntary verbal tics.” The racial slur made it to the BBC’s tape-delayed BAFTA telecast. ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 09:37:28

Popular on Variety Martin also won a second award for her work on the Prada “Galleria Bag” commercial. As Oscar voting is open, Deverell and Martin are both nominated in the production design category. The other nominees are for “Hamnet” (Production Design: Fiona Crombie; Set Decoration: Alice Felton), “Marty Supreme” (Production Design: Jack Fisk; Set Decoration: Adam Willis) and “Sinners” (Production Design: Hannah Beachler; Set Decoration: Monique Champagne). “Kpop Demon Hunters” continued its winning streak, collecting the ADG Award in feature animation. This past week it won 10 Annie Awards including best feature and three Visual Effects Society trophies. It also won the Producers Guild award . The guild handed out special honors tonight to filmmaker Jon M. Chu, whoreceived the Cinematic Imagery Award. Rep. Laura Friedman (D-CA) was presented with the set for the President’s Award. Production designer Thomas E. Sanders, (”Saving Private Ryan” and “Bram Stoker’s Dracula”) was inducted posthumously into the ADG Hall of Fame. The guild handed out four Lifetime Achievement Awards. Honorees included set designer and art director Jann Engel. Production designer Bo Welch. Production designer Tom Southwell and scenic artist Stephen McNally. Welch whose credits include “Men in Black,” “The Birdcage” and “Beetlejuice” dedicated his award to “my brilliant beautiful wife Catherine O’Hara and our sons Matthew and Luke, who all inspire me daily and are my greatest lifetime achievement.” O’Hara died on last month at her Los Angeles home, and was married to Welch. During her speech Friedman vowed to defend the film and television industry. Friedman who has been fighting for a national film credit, started her speech by talking about how films show the world what America is. “It’s why people was in immigrate here in the first place. It’s why people in other countries that don’t enjoy those freedoms understand what that would mean to their lives and to the lives of their children. So what you do does move hearts and minds.” Friedman told the room she had stopped reading from the teleprompter, and was speaking from the heart. She said, “We are going to finish the job of having a national film tax credit, because Hollywood is worth fighting for. The film industry is worth fighting for.” She said, “I will defend this industry. I will defend it from offshoring productions. I will defend it as much as I can from corporate consolidation. I will absolutely defend it from AI taking away the work of artists.” Friedman continued, “We’re going to fight for it in Georgia, New York, New Jersey, all across this country, because when we have a strong film and TV industry, America succeeds. So we are going to continue working on this tax credit. I have great faith that we are going to deliver for you.” Chu was mourning the end of his “Wicked” journey. As he accepted his award, he said, “Have you ever put so much love into something like true love that you never wanted it to end like it hurts, like it physically hurts your stomach to think about your life without it.” He said, “That’s where I’m at right now with ‘Wicked.’ That’s what it feels like for me to say goodbye to ‘Wicked,’ because this may be one of the last times I get to celebrate it.” He talked about the craft of production design and called on those who he had worked with throughout his career from Nelson Coates (“In the Heights”) to Nathan Crowley (“Wicked”). Chu called filmmaking “an empathy exercise built into our culture for generations, and design is what makes it possible. It is the official language of this connection.” He told the room of production designer and set decorators, “You are not simply designers. I think you are explorers.” Full list of 30th ADG Awards winners below: FEATURE FILM NOMINEES: PERIOD FEATURE FILM “Frankenstein” Production Designer: Tamara Deverell FANTASY FEATURE FILM “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” Production Designer: Kasra Farahani CONTEMPORARY FEATURE FILM “One Battle After Another” Production Designer: Florencia Martin ANIMATED FEATURE FILM “KPop Demon Hunters” Production Designers: Mingjue Helen Chen, Dave Bleich TELEVISION NOMINEES: ONE-HOUR PERIOD SINGLE-CAMERA SERIES Palm Royale: “Maxine Drinks Martini’s Now,” “Maxine Serves a Swerve” Production Designer: Jon Carlos ONE-HOUR FANTASY SINGLE-CAMERA SERIES Andor: “Who Are You?” Production Designer: Luke Hull ONE-HOUR CONTEMPORARY SINGLE-CAMERA SERIES Severance: “Chikhai Bardo” Production Designer: Jeremy Hindle TELEVISION MOVIE OR LIMITED SERIES Monster: The Ed Gein Story Production Designer: Matthew Flood Ferguson HALF-HOUR SINGLE-CAMERA SERIES The Studio: “The Note” Production Designer: Julie Berghoff MULTI-CAMERA SERIES Mid-Century Modern: “Bye, George” Production Designer: Glenda Rovello VARIETY OR REALITY SERIES Saturday Night Live: “Lady Gaga Host” Production Designers: Akira Yoshimura, Keith Ian Raywood, N.

Courtesy of Warner Bros. The 2026 Producers Guild Awards have been handed out, with One Battle After Another continuing its winning streak and taking home the night’s top award. The Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures has historically served as the best predictor of who will win best picture at the Oscars, because of the similar membership size between PGA and the Academy, and both of their use of the weighted preferential ballot. Bugonia , F1 , Frankenstein , Hamnet , Marty Supreme , One Battle After Another , Sentimental Value , Sinners , Train Dreams and Weapons were nominees for that honor, but One Battle was crowned the winner. Related Stories Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: 'Sinners' Dominates With 11 Wins, Including Best Motion Picture Movies Delroy Lindo Speaks Out on BAFTA Tourette's Incident at NAACP Image Awards: ""Something Negative Becoming Positive"" Director Paul Thomas Anderson used his time at the mic to shout out Warner Bros.’ Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, who were involved in the making of One Battle , Sinners and Weapons . “You’ve heard their names over and over again, [they] should get an award for enduring a lot on the road to get these films made. You kept your head down and you protected me; Ryan [Coogler], I’ll speak for you, protected Ryan, protected Zach [Creggar]. You’ve done an incredible job protecting us,” he said in his acceptance speech. “That’s real producing too — getting us out of the gate, letting us do our work, protecting us through the distribution and leading us here. And so whatever the road lies ahead, your work this year is so spectacular. I share this with you. None of us could have done this without the two of you guys and the entire team that you have around you. Long may you wave, whatever the future holds. It is one battle after another.” A total of 10 categories were announced, alongside awards for animated motion picture and a wide range of TV offerings. KPop Demon Hunters , The Pitt , The Studio , My Mom Jayne: A Film by Mariska Hargitay and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert are among those who also took home statues. Four awards were handed out ahead of Saturday night’s ceremony, with Formula 1: Drive to Survive , Sesame Street , Adolescence: The Making of Adolescence and The Wizard of Oz as those early winners. In addition to the competitive prizes, three special honors were presented: Amy Pascal received the David O. Selznick Award; Jason Blum the Milestone Award; and Mara Brock Akil the Norman Lear Award. Presenters at this year’s ceremony included Amy Madigan, Delroy Lindo, Elle Fanning, Emily V. Gordon, Greta Gerwig, Ike Barinholtz, Jacob Elordi, Jason Ritter, Jessie Buckley, Joachim Trier, Kate Hudson, Kerry Condon, Kumail Nanjiani, Lisa Gilroy, Mariska Hargitay, Michael Keaton, Odessa A’zion, Paul Mescal, Ralph Farquhar, Regina Hall, Seth Rogen, Teyana Taylor, Thomas Lennon, Vinny Thomas, Wagner Moura, William H. Macy and Wumni Mosaku. PGA executive director Susan Sprung kicked off the evening, acknowledging the events of the last 24 hours in the Middle East and “praying for peace.” She also addressed the recent deal for Paramount to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, saying, “I know all of us are also thinking about the future of one of our most storied studios and its implications for our industry more broadly. Please note that the guild’s position has not changed. We will continue to call on regulators for the scrutiny and ultimately the safeguards and protections that producers need, that everyone in this business deserves, and that are the right of those who consume what we create. The vitality of our industry is at stake and on that producers will not be silent.” Ralph Farquhar was on hand to present to Brock Akil, who told the room, “I have spent over three decades working inside systems that were not built with me in mind — learning them, navigating them, stretching them. I am deeply grateful to every collaborator, every writer in every writers room, every cast and crew member who trusted me with their talent, their time and their dreams.” Later in the show , Barry Diller appeared to present to Blum, as the horror mogul acknowledged, “We’re living at this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream in the mood we’re in next Tuesday. But what machines can’t do?” He then brought up the success of Heated Rivalry , noting, “If you would ask an algorithm a few months ago to predict a low-budget gay hockey romance with zero known stars, I promise you the algorithm would have been like, do not make that show. But that’s why Heated Rivalry needed us. It needed producers.” Blum added that he even invited the hit show’s producers to be his guests at the show, but they were in New York to watch Connor Storrie host SNL . And to close out the night, Greta Gerwig presented Pascal with her special honor, gushing that the producer was “the person I dreamed I would meet when I came to Hollywood: a gorgeous, wild, genius woman.” Pascal had the crowd laughing with her speech, particularly when she acknowledged that “the way I became a producer was pretty fucked, and then I got lucky, and then it was all really hard anyway.” She continued that there are many challenges to being a producer, including “knowing that no matter how bad things get, how many mistakes you made, how many failures you have, it’s never really over, no matter what anyone tells you.” A complete list of this year’s winners follows.

Selznick Award at the PGAs tonight. That sarcastic The PGA’s David O. Selznick Award recognizes a producer or producing team for their extraordinary body of work in motion pictures.

Watch on Deadline “All my life people have said relationships are bad for business, I really struggle with that,” she said paying thanks to every she worked with including, but not limited to “the Columbia Lady”, Sony Motion Pictures Chairman Tom Rothman, Netflix’s Ted Sarandos and Bela Bajaria, Amazon MGM Studios’ Mike Hopkins, Sue Kroll and Courtenay Valenti as well as PGA co-Presidents Donald DeLine (Pascal met him at UCLA and they “leapfrogged across West Hollywood from apartment to apartment) and Stephanie Allain (“allowed me to tag along with her to Aunt Kizzy’s back porch where I watched as she persuaded John Singleton to make Boyz in the Hood with us). She also gave thanks to her husband Bernie Weintraub, son Anthony, sister Jenny and producing partner Rachel O’Connor (“who when Sony got hacked, begged me to take her to wherever I was going”). “How can it be possible that relationships are not at the heart of it all?” exclaimed Pascal. “When I first became a producer sitting in the office I stole back from Seth and Evan, recently fumigated to get rid of the weed smell, I was wondering why directors and actors and writers no longer agreed with everything I said. Well duh. I was no longer holding that metaphorical green light gun in my hand.” Beamed the current producer of the 007 movies, “Receiving the David O. Selznick Award from my peers and by my peers, I mean all of you in this room have the audacity to make things happen, well that is really something. But let’s be honest, the only thing the legendary David O. Selznick and I have in common is that we both write a lot of notes and both love uppers which probably explains all the notes.” “Being a producer is sitting in the editing room with Chris and Phil having stayed up all night long, watching every cut of our movie, certain I have the most brilliant idea then politely listening and then doing something totally different and thanking God they did.” “Being a producer is trying to do jedi mind tricks out of a port-a-potty wearing pairs of hand warmers.” “Being a producer is sitting in a meeting hearing the germ of an idea and having the patience not to kill it before it even exists.” “Being a producer is having the self-confidence or at least pretending that you do so that when Kevin (Feige) says I think I can help you, you let him.” “Being a producer is falling in love with a book, the author choosing Plan B or Luckychap or David Heyman instead of you.” “Being a producer is the shocking realization that you’re not gonna be good at everything and that some people are just better than you. You better figure out what you are honestly obsessed with and fight like hell to make it happen.” “Being a producer is knowing that there is no such thing as a great movie without a great director.” “And being a producer is knowing that no matter how bad things get, how many mistakes you make, and how many failures you have, it’s never really over no matter what anyone tells you.” The honor was presented to Pascal by 4x Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig, the former having produced the latter’s Oscar winning Little Women and upcoming Netflix mega film, Narnia. Gerwig spoke about pitching Pascal to allow the actress to direct Little Women. Gerwig was bowled over by how Pascal took a chance on her. Gerwig quipped that Pascal tonight is “honored, excited, and she wants to leave because she wants to go back to work.” Gerwig says Pascal gave her note about her presentation speech tonight, to specify that not all the films in her reel she produced. Some she greenlit (i.e. Superbad, This is the End , Men in Black ) and greenlighting and producing are not the same thing. Said Pascal at the top of her acceptance speech, “I knew how important Greta was gonna be to me when I told her my favorite book was the Little Fur Family and she said ‘Oh, my God! My favorite part of that book is the page where the little bear watches a tinier bear disappear down a hole and I gasped and said ‘Me too!'” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 09:37:31

Current Paramount chairman and CEO Ellison, who has been in the news in recent days for the mega merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery, is a licensed pilot for helicopter aviation, aerobatics and more. Warner, of course, was the founder and president of Warner Bros. Studios. Related Stories Movies PGA Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: 'Sinners' Dominates With 13 Wins, Including Best Motion Picture Diller, a longtime friend of Blum’s, continued: “Cecil B. DeMille, Disney, and now Blum: Not the most obvious succession, but then you also gave this award to Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves. So there’s that.” Diller continued his introduction by making quips at Blum’s “cheapness.” Of course, Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse (behind horror franchises like P aranormal Activity , Insidious , The Black Phone , The Purge ), is well known for investing small amounts of money in films and giving directors their creative freedom. For example, 2007’s Paranormal Activity was made for just $15,000 but grossed almost $200 million worldwide. “There’s some commonality with the greats,” Diller continued. “DeMille made movies for $15,000 and so did Blum almost 100 years later. To say he’s cheap isn’t a characterization. It’s a defining attribute. … I’m giving this award to Jason, not because I like horror movies; I actually hate them. But because we’ve been friends since before he matriculated, if that’s the right word to describe working for Harvey Weinstein. How he found his groove after that is anyone’s guess, but he sure did find it.” Blum served as an executive for Bob and Harvey Weinstein at their production company Miramax before becoming an independent producer at Paramount and founding Blumhouse Productions in 2000. Diller continued: “300 films made on the lowest pay scales in film history, but he also did something quite extraordinary in itself, and that’s helping artists tell stories and helping them make a lot of money. … Once Jason found his calling, he focused with an intensity that is rare in this business, and that’s worth saying because Hollywood is essentially a machine that’s designed to distract you. There’s always a bigger budget being dangled in front of you, a more prestigious kind of movie that will get you an awards campaign or a franchise that someone swears is going to change everything. The shiny objects in this town are endless. Jason though stayed focused on scary and people betting on themselves … Jason is this odd something of a Renaissance man, a true embodiment of a man [who] can do all things if it is his will. And it is his will and his stick to perseverance of what he believes in and how essentially honest and honorable he has been that makes me ever so glad to be able to present this award to him.” When Blum took the stage to accept the Milestone Award, he joked, “I think my biggest achievement is getting Barry Diller to the PGAs!” “Barry’s been a friend of mine for a long time and a mentor of mine and someone I admire so, so much,” he added. “And he’s changed my life is a lot of ways.” During his acceptance speech, the horror mogul also talked about how AI cannot replicate the passions and tastes of a producer. “We’re living at this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream in the mood we’re in next Tuesday. But what machines can’t do?” He then brought up the success of Heated Rivalry , noting, “If you would ask an algorithm a few months ago to predict a low-budget gay hockey romance with zero known stars, I promise you the algorithm would have been like, ‘Do not make that show.’ But that’s why Heated Rivalry needed us. It needed producers.” Blum added that he even invited the hit show’s producers to be his guests at the show, but they were in New York to watch Connor Storrie host Saturday Night Live .

Well, rather, he crashed into Storrie and SNL stars Mikey Day and Ben Marshall, all of whom were playing happy-go-lucky pals ice skating at the Rockefeller Center rink, who were unwittingly interrupting a disastrous proposal between Veronika Slowikowska and Tommy Brennan’s characters.

Slowikowska and Brennan were in the foreground trying to tamp down a smile amid the applause. Watch on Deadline Throughout the sketch, Slowikowska attempts to redirect her would-be-fiance’s attention to their romantic disintegration, as he becomes increasingly distracted by the skaters’ unabated whimsy and random lore. “I’ve never felt so cool,” Williams says as he forms a conga line with the fellas. In response, Brennan balks at the idea — surely, Williams has experienced cooler things? “How is that possible,” he questions. “I don’t know, it’s just how I feel,” Slowikowska’s Candace says. “No, sorry, I meant, like, how is ice skating in a four-person train the coolest that that guy has ever felt?” At another point, Storrie’s character is revealed to be Kendrick Lamar’s producer, and Brennan once again interrupts Slowikowska to express disbelief that the guy has any connection to the Grammy-winning rapper. As Slowikowska struggles to once again pivot the conversation to their dying relationship and diverging life paths, Brennan is shown on the ice, dismissively saying, “OK, sounds good.

In a rare Hollywood appearance, specifically onstage, the former Paramount CEO, Fox CEO and current Who Knew author took digs at Jack Warner, David Ellison , Harvey Weinstein as well as the guy he was presenting the PGA Milestone Award to, his amigo, Jason Blum . Diller began, “Samuel Goldwyn, Adolph Zukor, Jack Warner — what would Jack Warner do if he knew he was being succeeded by a stunt pilot?” That latter dig being directed at Paramount CEO, David Ellison, who recently won the bid for Warner Bros. Related Stories News Jason Blum Rallies Producers to Keep Believing In The ""Impossible"" As He Accepts PGA Milestone Award News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List: 'KPop Demon Hunters' Takes Animated Category - Updating Live Diller went on, “Cecil B. Demille and now Jason Blum.” Watch on Deadline The Chairman and Senior executive of IAC and Expedia Group reminded the Fairmont Century Plaza ballroom full of producers “you also gave this award to Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves, so there it is. There is commonality with the greats.” “DeMille made movies for $15,000, and so did Blum almost 100 years later. To say he’s cheap isn’t a characterization, it’s a defining attribute,” continued Diller. “Take his approach to air travel, where instead of buying a first-class ticket for an overnight flight, Jason would buy three cheap seats, all together, bring an actual inflatable mattress on board the plane, and then horrify fellow passengers with the loud motor of his electric pump. But he’s serene in all this, as in all of his other cheap eccentricities. Jason’s an intermittent faster, in that he only eats food if the food is free, and as my wife once observed, when Jason’s on our boat, he behaves like a tourist at an all-inclusive resort.” “I’m giving this award to Jason not because I like horror movies, I actually hate them, but because we’ve been friends since before he matriculated, if that’s the right word to describe working for Harvey Weinstein. How he found his groove after that is anyone’s guess, but he sure did find it. 300 films — made on the lowest pay scales in film history — but he also did something quite extraordinary in itself, and that’s helping artists tell stories and helping them make a lot of money. Along the way, and rarely, did the two go hand in hand,” exclaimed Diller. Diller praised Blum for staying focused on his mission for low budget fare with high profit margins versus projects promising awards campaigns or tentpole franchises possibilities. “The shiny objects in this town are endless. Jason, though, stayed focused on scary and people betting on themselves,” said Diller. In summing up Blum, Diller (who recently came out in his memoir) further ribbed the horror producer as a guy who’s “married with children, lots of them, and hoping that they don’t emulate his favorite pleasures like dressing in drag, wearing diamond jewelry, and riding a unicycle.” “But Jason is this odd something of a Renaissance man. A true embodiment of, ‘A man can do all things if he will.’ And it is his will and his stick-to perseverance of what he believes in and how essentially honest and honorable has been that which makes me ever so glad to be able to present this award to him.” Taking the stage, Blum exclaimed, “I think my biggest achievement is getting Barry Diller to the PGAs!” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 09:37:33

Storrie began with the typical opener fare, poking fun at the Crave Canada show’s “spicy” scenes by showcasing a single-second clip of his character, Ilya Rozanov delivering the word “OK,” as the only one cleared to air for promo on broadcast. Related Stories Late Night TV ‘Saturday Night Live’ Opens With Quickly Scripted Sketch Of Trump Exulting In War With Iran: “My Board Of Peace Decided We Were Bored Of Peace” Late Night TV ‘Heated Rivalry’ Star Hudson Williams Skates Onto Connor Storrie’s ‘SNL’ Debut In Cameo In an extended bit, an earnest Storrie then pivoted to a trio of dramatic asides, in which he played up being a self-serious ac tor . But upon delving into the difficulties of his HR role — learning Russian and how to play hockey — he was interrupted by brothers Quinn Hughes and Jack Hughes , who were part of the men’s hockey team that won Olympic gold in Milan. Quinn Hughes assured Storrie he was “great” at playing hockey on screen, while Jack Hughes said, “I got my teeth knocked out in the final, does that happen in your show?” Watch on Deadline “Metaphorically,” Storrie replied cheekily, wagging his eyebrows at the Studio 8H audience. But the applause the Hughes siblings got paled in comparison to the extended cheers received by Team USA women’s hockey champions Hilary Knight and Megan Keller , who also clinched Olympic gold. “Don’t worry, we saw your show,” Keller told Storrie, after the Hughes brothers admitted they hadn’t watched Heated Rivalry yet. It was a not-so-subtle truce to end the kerfuffle spurred by a locker room video that featured the men’s team, post-win, laughing along with President Donald Trump when he joked he had to reluctantly also invite the women’s team to the White House. “It was gonna be just us, but we thought we’d invite the guys too,” Knight said knowingly. Meanwhile, Quinn Hughes admitted that the last time the men won gold was 46 years ago, while the women did so two “whole Olympics ago.” Watch the monologue above. Admittedly, it’s frustrating that Storrie’s debut was overshadowed by the Hugheses having to awkwardly deliver redress for their team’s misogyny. Earlier this week, the two had appeared on Good Morning America and tepidly addressed the video, as well as the men’s team’s decision to visit with Trump in the Oval Office. (The women’s team declined the invitation .) “I’m glad you mentioned the women’s team again. We’re extremely happy for them. Obviously, a lot going on with social media right now surrounding our team and their team,” Quinn Hughes said in part. Meanwhile, Jack Hughes said during a press conference later : “It is what it is now, like, we have so much respect for the women’s team, they have so much respect for us, and we’re all just proud Americans. We’re happy that we both swept the Olympics.” Knight told GMA Thursday , “I thought the call in itself was distasteful and an awesome learning moment to refocus the narrative and understand our words matter, and how we speak about women matters, and we need to celebrate this team.” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 09:37:35

A few moments later on “ SNL ,” Williams came back out to introduce Mumford and Sons, alongside Storrie. The duo is best known for playing hockey duo Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander on the steamy series, produced by Crave. The hockey drama is based on Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” book series. “Now, some of you may have seen literally all of me on my show. It’s a show that has taught a lot of people about hockey, and it’s taught a lot of straight women that their sexuality is actually gay guy,” Storrie said when he opened the show . He later brought out both the women’s and men’s Olympic hockey teams. “I got my teeth knocked out in the finals. Does that happen in your show?” Jack Hughes asked Storrie, who cheekily responded, “Metaphorically.” “Heated Rivalry,” which aired on HBO Max, became a massive hit for the streamer in its first season.

Referring to himself humbly as “this lowly middle-aged producer,” Blum said Diller’s “been a friend of mine for a long time and a mentor of mine, and someone I admire so, so much, and he’s changed my life in a lot of ways.” The mega horror producer also thanked his wife Lauren, who “supports me in everything I do”; CAA’s Bryan Lourd, “who believed in before anyone else did”; Universal’s Donna Langley, “who gave Blumhouse a home when we had basically produced a half a movie”; and his “partner” in the newest chapter of his career, “one of the greatest artists I’ve worked with in my life, “James Wan. Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List - Updating Live News PGA's Daryl F. Zanuck Outstanding Producer Nominees Talk Shop Before Awards Show: ""Producing Is Hard, It Is Ghetto"" The crux of Blum’s speech, though, was a story about his parents — and his father, specifically — who while running The Ferus Gallery on La Cienega decades ago, somehow convincing the artist Andy Warhol not only that his iconic 32-piece set of Campbell soup can paintings needed to remain together, but that he should sell them to him for just $2000. Watch on Deadline “That story has stayed with me and it’s in my bones, and it taught me that good taste doesn’t come from consensus. That belief has to come before validation,” Blum told the crowd. “In hindsight, it seems like what my dad did seems easy. But it wasn’t, it was impossible. Everyone was making fun of these paintings. They hung them in their kitchen. And my dad is like, ‘I’m eating tuna fish sandwiches, and I’m going to spend all my money and buy these paintings.” Similarly, Blum said, good producing is “impossible” — and producers, themselves , are impossible. It’s hard to pin down the job of the producer, he suggested, and how they pull off what they do. But he said he believes we can define their craft as the effort “to somehow bring all of us impossible people together. To keep the team intact. To keep the soup cans in tact — even when it would be easier, faster, and more lucrative to sell them off one at a time.” Today, Blum continued, “we’re living in this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream and the mood we’re in next Tuesday.” What machines cannot do, however, is “fall in love with something,” or “have instinct.” Said the producer, “If you had asked an algorithm a few months ago to predict how a low-budget gay hockey romance with zero known stars would perform, I promise you the algorithm would’ve been like ‘Do not make that show.’ But that’s why Heated Rivalry needed us; it needed producers.” The show’s key creatives, Jacob Tierney and Brendan Brady, believed in it when perhaps no one else did — and it’s that belief, Blum said, “in artists, in stories, and the road it takes to get things made” that producers as a community do “better than anyone else.” In the past, Blum said, he wasn’t one to tell stories “about people who believed in [someone] before anyone else.” But he’s come to realize that “those stories are really, really important because they tell the next generation that producing matters, that passion matters. That belief matters. That sometimes —oftentimes — the market is wrong.” In winding down, Blum left his audience with the message, “Keep believing in your stories, and in your impossible directors and impossible actors and impossible writers, and most of all, impossible producers, even when we are at our most impossible.” The PGA’s Milestone Award recognizes individuals or teams who have made historic contributions to the entertainment industry. Other contemporary recipients of the prize, once given out to the likes of Louis B. Mayer, Walt Disney and Alfred Hitchcock, include Steven Spielberg, Sherry Lansing, James Cameron, Bob Iger, Donna Langley, Ted Sarandos, George Lucas and Kathleen Kennedy, Charles D. King, and Dana Walden. The founder of Blumhouse, the horror powerhouse that merged with Wan’s Atomic Monster in 2024, Blum’s recent producing credits include Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 , Black Phone 2 , The Lost Bus , and the USA Networks series The Rainmaker , based on the novel by John Grisham. This year’s PGA Awards are taking place at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles. Other honorees include Amy Pascal, who’s receiving the David O.

In the Feb. 28 cold open, Trump (played by James Austin Johnson) gives a press conference about the military action. “It’s me, Donald Trump , FIFA Peace Prize winner and Nobel Peace Prize taker,” he began. “Remember that? I launched this attack after me and my board of peace…we were bored of peace. A little wordplay there, did you catch it? As we all know, Iran has been two weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon for like the last 15 years or something. So we had to act now, and we’re doing war.” Trump soon brought out his secretary of war Pete Hegseth (played by Colin Jost) to speak on the military action. Popular on Variety “They asked for someone to volunteer to receive his half-baked operation, and I didn’t walk — I ran,” Jost-as-Hegseth said. “President Trump called me at two in the morning, and you know, I was awake, sober AF.” Hegseth then admitted that “I don’t know what I’m doing.” “Heated Rivalry” star Connor Storrie was the host of the Feb. 28 show, with Mumford & Sons as the musical guest. USA men’s hockey stars Quinn and Jack Hughes crashed Storrie’s monologue, as well as USA women’s hockey stars Megan Keller and Hilary Knight.

Following the cold open , Storrie — who plays Russian hockey player Ilya Rozanov on HBO’s hit hockey romance TV series “Heated Rivalry” opposite Hudson Williams as Canadian hockey star Shane Hollander — kicked off his monologue, saying: “I am so excited to be here. Now, some of you may have seen literally all of me on my show. It’s a show that has taught a lot of people about hockey, and it’s taught a lot of straight women that their sexuality is actually gay guy.” Related Stories 'Bridgerton' Star Yerin Ha on Sophie and Benedict's Two Very Different Sex Scenes, Hoping for 'Benophie Babies' in Future Seasons 'Bridgerton' Star Katie Leung on Embracing Her Role as Season 4 Villain Lady Araminta: 'I Love That People Love to Hate Her' After making a few more jokes about the cultural phenomenon surrounding “Heated Rivalry” and expressing excitement over the explosive rise in his acting career that’s brought him to “ Saturday Night Live ,” Storrie brought out brothers and USA men’s hockey stars Quinn and Jack Hughes, who said they’ve been too busy with the Olympics to watch the show yet. Popular on Variety “It’s about hockey, right?” Quinn Hughes said. “Kind of,” Storrie joked. “I got my teeth knocked out in the finals, does that happen in your show?” Jack Hughes said. “Metaphorically,” Storrie responded with a knowing smirk. When Storrie said he hoped “some hockey players watched it,” USA women’s hockey stars Megan Keller and Hilary Knight came out on stage to roaring applause from Storrie, the Hughes brothers and the Studio 8H audience. “Don’t worry, we saw your show,” Keller said, once the cheers had settled down. Knight joked that, “it was gonna be just us” who joined Storrie on “SNL,” “but we thought we’d invite the guys, too.” “Yeah, we thought we’d give them a little moment to shine,” Keller added. The bit was a reference to a controversy that started when the men’s hockey team won at the Olympics, and Donald Trump called to invite them to attend the State of the Union address. Recordings circulated of Trump’s phone call with the team, during which he could be heard saying, “I must tell you, we’re gonna have to bring the women’s team — you do know that,” adding that he felt if he didn’t invite them, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.” Everyone was then heard laughing. Following the call, the women’s team declined to attend the State of the Union address. Since then, the men’s hockey team players have received backlash from fans for their reaction to Trump’s comments and not speaking up on behalf of the women’s team. During his “SNL” monologue, Storrie congratulated all the players on gold-medaling at the recent Olympics. “Thanks, the last time the men did that was 46 years ago,” Quinn Hughes said. Knight added with pride: “And the last time we did that was two whole Olympics ago.” “Nice burn,” Jack Hughes said, adding: “But these gold medals aren’t just for us, they’re for all hockey fans. Yours too.” Storrie asked if that meant he, a fictional hockey star, could touch one, to which all four responded: “No.” Watch Storrie’s “SNL” monologue featuring the women’s and men’s USA hockey team players in the video below.

The sketch found a couple hashing through a rejected proposal. Storrie, alongside the SNL cast members, in the sketch yelled about someone finally showing up. Williams then slid onto the ice and into Storrie, met with huge cheers from the audience.

The sketch comedy series released its typical two teasers — the first showing Storrie partaking in an “accent duel” and the second showing him “making out” with cast member Sarah Sherman and Mumford & Sons. The show also released a charming blooper reel of the actor’s first teaser. Storrie’s SNL debut comes just months after his breakout role in the queer hockey drama, Heated Rivalry . Hailing from Canadian streamer Crave and airing on HBO Max in the U.S., the series centers on a fictional hockey universe based on popular romance books by Rachel Reid. Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney created, wrote and directed the series. Heated Rivalry focuses on two rival professional players — Canada-born Shane Hollander (Williams) of the fictitious Montreal Metros and Russia-born Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) of the fictitious Boston Raiders — as they navigate a near-decade-long situationship- turned-relationship. The show has made certified stars out of both Storrie and Williams. The pair began last month presenting at the Golden Globes and closed the month serving as torchbearers in the 2026 Olympic Torch Relay. Storrie’s seemingly already found his first post- Heated Rivalry role; he’s in talks to join the ensemble cast of Molly Gordon and SNL writer Allie Levitan’s A24 comedy Peaked . Williams has also found his next role, re-teaming with Crave for the Carrie-Anne Moss-led series, Yaga . Crave renewed Heated Rivalry for a second season early into the show’s first season run. HBO Max has confirmed it will continue to air the series. The show is slated to shoot the second season this summer — Tierney said it would shoot in August on a recent TV appearance. It’s aiming for a spring 2027 release , Bell Media and Crave told THR in a statement. Reid announced earlier this year that she’ll be publishing her seventh book in the Game Changers series, which Heated Rivalry and its sequel The Long Game belong to. The book, Unrivaled , will be the next chapter in Shane and Ilya’s story. She announced earlier this week that she’d be pushing the book to a 2027 release date. Ryan Gosling will host next week’s episode of SNL , where he’ll be joined by musical guest Gorillaz. And on March 14, Harry Styles will pull double duty as host and musical guest .

One, it’s after the stock market closes for the weekend. And two, it’s to cause immeasurable fear, rage and chaos in the SNL writers room.

So we had to act now, and we’re doing war. War. What is it good for? Districting from the Epstein files.” The attack on Iran has split some in the MAGA movement, with figures like former Rep.

Stories are infrastructure. They shape how we see ourselves. They shape how we see each other, and they shape what we believe is possible,” she said. “As producers, we are architects of imagination. That is not small work. The characters we center, the worlds we normalize, the dignities we extend, those choices ripple.” It is “a profound privilege,” Akil said, “to tell stories about love: love of family, love of friendship, love of co-workers, ambition, vulnerability, and joy. Stories that insisted on nuance for stereotypes once lived. That work was never about representation. It was about expansion.” Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List: 'The Studio' & 'Colbert' Take Early Categories - Updating Live News PGA's Daryl F. Zanuck Outstanding Producer Nominees Talk Shop Before Awards Show: ""Producing Is Hard, It Is Ghetto"" At this stage of her journey, she continued, “I feel called to build differently, to create structures where the next generation of storytellers don’t have to push as hard just to be heard, to create ecosystems, not just shows. I think about this not only as a producer, but as a mother.” Watch on Deadline Now young men, her sons are watching the show tonight. “They are forming their ideas about leadership, partnership, power, and integrity. And one day, they and their generation will shape whatever comes next. What are we leaving them with?” she asked. “I don’t want them to inherit an industry that requires extraordinary resilience just to belong. I want them to inherit one that assumes their brilliance from the start.” “If I have done anything worthy of this honor, I hope it is this — that I helped make room,” Akil continued. “Room for more voices. Room for fuller humanity. Room for stories that once waited quietly at the margins. Because stories change culture. But space, space changes, who gets to tell it.” Akil began her remarks by paying tribute to one of her great mentors, Ralph Farquhar, who presented her with tonight’s honor. “Ralph, thank you for being with me tonight. It’s an honor to thank you in front of this illustrious audience for teaching me how to make television,” she said. “You told me, one part talent, two parts integrity, and three parts hard work, especially when no one is looking. Mix it up. Bake it at joy. Add some gratitude. And for those last 15 minutes, turn that bad boy up until I’ve exhausted the privilege of telling the story, but still have enough energy left to be thrilled, in awe even, that the little idea I have could rise into a television series worth watching. I am so proud to be a part of your family tree.” Countless talents have come up under Farquhar’s stewardship, she said, naming the many occasions where she worked with him. “34 years ago, as your stage PA on The Sinbad Show , 32 years ago as your writer’s trainee on South Central , 30 years ago as a staff writer on Moesha , you gave me a place to develop and shine,” she shared. “I pitched nonstop, but you never told me to shut up. You did tell me to save it for my pilot, and I did. And it’s called Girlfriends . You recognized my gift for placing music, and I still owe you receipts for all those CDs I bought at Tower Records. They’re out of business, but thank God you’re still here.” Akil remembered being terrified the first time Farquhar asked her to “laugh the show,” explaining, “for those of you in earlier generations, that’s where you enhanced the laughs on a comedy show.” What Akil didn’t realize when Farquhar entrusted her with this responsibility, she said, was that it marked “the beginning of my journey as a producer.” She said she takes that title seriously and is “filled with tremendous gratitude for this once-in-a-lifetime honor” from the PGA. Continued Akil, “Ralph, when you hired me when I was young, ambitious, and probably a little impatient, you didn’t just give me a job. You gave me proximity to possibility. You taught me that producing is not about power, it’s about stewardship, protecting the story, protecting the people who make it, and sometimes protecting the truth from fear. Thank you for seeing me before the industry fully did.” Speaking further of Lear, Akil told the crowd, “Nothing can be more meaningful than to be honored in the name of the late, great Norman Lear. Norman didn’t just produce television, he produced conversation. He disrupted comfort. He invited America to see itself sometimes beautifully, sometimes uncomfortably, but always honestly. That standard shaped me.” Elsewhere in her remarks, she said, “I have spent over three decades working inside systems that were not built with me in mind, learning them, navigating them, stretching them, and I am deeply grateful to every collaborator, every writer in every writer’s room, every cast and crew member who trusted me with their talent, their time, and their dreams.” Known for creating series like Girlfriends , The Game , and Forever , Akil is one of three big honorees tonight, the others being Amy Pascal (who’s receiving the David O. Selznick Achievement Award) and Jason Blum (who is getting the Milestone Award).

(Or at least for the last time for the next three years.) To the surprise of probably few people, the awards program will henceforth be known as “The Trump Kennedy Center Honors,” in keeping with the effort of the board installed by President Donald J. Trump to rebrand everything related to the institution with his name. The show will also take place at an alternative, smaller venue for at least the next couple of years, and not at the historic hall in Washington, D.C. that was had its own name change to give the president top billing, under authority that is still disputed by many experts. Related Stories 'Bridgerton' Costume Designers on Making the Lady in Silver 'Forgettable,' 'Sexier' Maid Uniforms and Benedict's Leather Bracelet Series Creators Push Back as the Industry Gets ‘Nervous’ About Important Stories and Female Perspective: ‘The Content Might Be Different Enough to Actually Make a Difference’ The program “will definitely go forward,” said Richard Grenell , the president of the center, in an interview with D.C. news radio station WTOP. “It will probably just be in a smaller venue, which just means ticket demand will be even higher.” Popular on Variety The new location for “The Trump Kennedy Center Honors” “is yet to be determined,” but “we’re already looking for different places,” Grenell told the news station. The Washington Post confirmed Grenell’s radio revelation about the name change and move with representatives of the center on Saturday. The reason the show will have to find a different home is due to the fact that the Kennedy Center – or Trump Kennedy Center, depending on where you stand — is set to close for a couple of years for an extensive and controversial overhaul. Grenell’s announcement of the closure, scheduled to take place this year, followed a series of news reports about withdrawals from the center by cultural institutions or individual artists that left its calendar for 2026 severely underpopulated. Some who have decried the politicization of the center under the Trump administration have held that the highly unexpected move to submit the center to an extensive makeover is a cover for the inability to draw top acts and full houses amid the current polarization, although Grenell has maintained that it is because the building is dilapidated. The most recent broadcast of what was then still called “ The Kennedy Center Honors ” was hosted by Trump and saluted artists who have a friendly relationship with the president. Trump said that he wanted to weed out “wokesters” from receiving the honors, and noted that the five recipients — Kiss, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and Michael Crawford — “all went through me.” The president predicted that the first “Kennedy Center Honors” to feature him as host and curator., broadcast on Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would be “the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done.” That did not come to pass, as the 48th annual show delivered the lowest ratings in the history of the program. It was down by 26 percent from the year before, with Nielsen reporting an average 4.1 million viewers. The ratings were not a concern to the center, according to Roma Daravi, VP of public relations for the center, who said in a statement: “Comparing this year’s broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias… The program performed extremely well across key demographics and platforms, despite industry and timing disadvantages, including a Tuesday air date two days before Christmas… With overall television usage down roughly 20% year over year, the broadcast still tied for the No. 1 spot among adults aged 25–54, alongside a live NBA doubleheader.” Trump spoke to the news about the Kennedy Center’s impending closure at a February news conference, saying he plans to keep the exterior of the building as it is, but making no such promises for the interior. “I’m not ripping it down,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure.” Touting the $200 million renovation, he added, “It’s in very bad shape… sort of dangerous.” He promised the renovated center will feature “the highest-grade marbles, the highest-grade everything… I think there won’t be anything like it in the country.” Naturally, many eyes will be on not just where the “Trump Kennedy Centers” lands as it exits its longtime home, but who the president will secure for a second set of hand-picked or -chosen recipients in the arts. Most of the honorees selected for the 2025 honors do not have fan bases that would likely rise up against them being associated with Trump, although the band Cheap Trick, which performed in honor of their old friends in Kiss, suffered a significant backlash on social media just for playing at the event. Grenell has argued that is only the left that is politicizing the center, although he is not shy about sharing his political beliefs as director, sometimes using his X account to post dozens of pro-MAGA or anti-Democrat tweets per day.

Peter Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal round out the cast. The Bride! — which debuts in theaters March 6 — is inspired by the 1935 sequel Bride of Frankenstein , in itself a loose adaptation of a side-plot first introduced in Mary Shelley’s indelible 1818 work. In the original sci-fi novel, Victor Frankenstein is beseeched by his creation to create a companion, but after being plagued by visions of what this second attempt may bring (namely the breeding of additional monsters), the scientist destroys the companion before it is brought to life. ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 09:37:40

Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy were in the room at the Fairmont Century Plaza as Anderson made oblique references to the drama surrounding the sale of the studio’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. Related Stories 'Bridgerton' Launches Polly Pocket, NYX Valentine's Day Set in Big Merch Push Ahead of Season 4 Finale (EXCLUSIVE) ‘Bridgerton’ Star Yerin Ha Named 2026 Actor Awards Ambassador “Whatever the road lies ahead — your work this year is so spectacular. I share this with you. Long may you wave, whatever the future holds. It is one battle after another,” Anderson said. He praised the pair for championing original material and unconventional filmmakers, such as Ryan Coogler and Zach Cregger, whose films “ Sinners ” and “Weapons” were also nommed for the top PGA honor. Popular on Variety De Luca and Abdy deserve “to get an award for enduring a lot — a lot — on the road to get these films made,” Anderson said. “You kept your head down and you protected me. You protected Ryan. You protected Zach. That’s real producing. Letting us do our work and leading us here.” The night’s other top winners included Apple TV’s “The Studio” and HBO Max’s “The Pitt,” for episodic comedy and drama, respectively. Neflix’s “Adolescence” added another trophy to its long list of wins by prevailing for limited series. Susan Sprung, CEO of the PGA, opened the event on a somber note with a nod to the U.S. military action that has unfolded over the past day. “The events of the past 24 hours have us all concerned,” Sprung told the crowd at the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel. “Even as we go about our lives, even as we celebrate, forever, we pray for peace.” Sprung also made a reference to the drama that has engulfed Warner Bros., one of Hollywood’s foundational studios, with Paramount Skydance making a successful eleventh-hour bid for the company, prompting Netflix to bow out of the deal it reached in December. Sprung did not cite WBD by name but said that the guild was keeping watch on the impact of the consolidation of two of Hollywood’s major studios — Paramount and Warner Bros. — and its impact on the creative community. Sprung told the crowd that the PGA’s position on the WBD-Paramount deal is to advocate for a thorough regulatory process to apply the scrutiny and safeguard and protections that producers need and everyone in this business deserves, and for the rights of everyone who consumes what we create,” she said. The honorary kudos that were presented provided some of the most poignant moments on a night when winners made reference to the challenges that Hollywood and the entertainment industry face in a moment of rapid change. Showrunner Mara Brock Akil delivered an emotional speech as she accepted the Norman Lear Achievement Award from her early mentor, writer-producer Ralph Farquhar. Brock Akil, who is one of the most prominent Black showrunners and series creators in TV, noted that she has spent the past 35 years “working inside systems that were not built with me in mind.” “As producers we are architects of imagination. That is not small work,” she said. “It is a profound privilege to tell stories about love.” Brock Akil emphasized that at this stage of her career her greatest contribution is helping to nurture inexperienced writers from underrepresented backgrounds. “If I have done anything to deserve this award it is that I helped make room for more voices. Room for fuller humanity. Room for stories that once waited quietly at the margins,” she said. Prolific producer Jason Blum received the PGA’s Milestone Award for his contributions in forging a new business model for film production. His kudo was introduced by none other than Barry Diller, who gave the honoree a few jabs before hailing his success in building his Blumhouse studio as an independent operation. Diller said flatly that he “hated” horror movies but has been friendly with Blum for years. (Diller also took a thinly veiled shot at Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison, who is a pilot, when he made reference to Jack L. Warner: “What would Jack Warner do to know he’d been succeeded by a stunt pilot?”) “When Jason’s on our boat he behaves like tourist at an all-inclusive resort,” Diller joked. But he also praised him “as something of a Renaissance man. He is the true embodiment that a man can do all things if he will.” Blum paid tribute to his parents, both 95, who were in the audience. He shared a long yarn about how his father was early to recognize the genius of Andy Warhol in the late 1950s when Irving Blum ran an art gallery in Los Angeles. Irving Blum took the leap of buying Warhol’s first set of 32 paintings of Campbell’s Soup cans – long before they were iconic examples of pop art. Blum compared his father’s faith in Warhol to the faith that producers need to get movie and TV series made. He noted how “impossible” people in Hollywood can be, particularly creative artists. The producer’s ultimate job is to wrangle all of that impossible-ness to get a production to the finish line. “Somehow, we’re here to bring all of us impossible people together. To keep the team intact. To keep the soup cans intact even though it would’ve been faster and more lucrative to sell them individually.” Veteran studio executive turned producer Amy Pascal was celebrated with the David O. Selznick Achievement Award. Greta Gerwig, director of “Barbie” and the upcoming “Chronicles of Narnia” adaptation for Netflix, spoke from the heart as she described how Pascal supported her audacious desire to write and direct 2019’s “Little Women,” which established Gerwig as a director to watch. “I’m floored by the faith she placed in me,” Gerwig said. “Nothing in this world that gives me more joy than when Amy loves something.” Pascal was characteristically blunt in discussing her evolution from Sony Pictures chief to producer in the wake of the drama that ensued at the studio after the 2014 hack of its email systems by agents of North Korea. Pascal was forced out of her executive role by the fallout. But she has since rebounded with her success as a busy producer shepherding high-profile projects including Gerwig’s “Narnia” film. “The way I became a producer was pretty fucked. And then I got lucky,” Pascal said, citing friends and industry associates who helped her make the transition. Pascal then reeled off a few truisms about producing that she has learned over the past decade. “Being a producer is doing Jedi mind tricks outside a Port-a-Potty wearing three sets of handwarmers,” she said. “Being a producer is knowing there’s no such thing as a great movie without a great director.” Perhaps most important, she added, being a producer means having the self-confidence to know “it’s never really over no matter what anyone tells you.” Earlier in the week, PGA winners in sports, children and short-form programming categories were announced. “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” “Sesame Street” and “Adolescence: The Making of Adolescence” won those three categories, respectively. The producing team behind “The Wizard of Oz at Sphere” won the PGA Innovation Award. Lydia Dean Pilcher (“Queen of Katwe,” “Radium Girls”) also received the Vance Van Petten Entrepreneurial Spirit Producing Award.

Sam Smith has kicked off his residency at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco , with the singer’s 20-date stint helping to officially usher in a new era for the historic landmark. First erected in 1922, the Castro closed in 2024 for a reported $41 million renovation project. But the century-old Spanish-style Baroque theatre is open for business — and music — once again, with its gilded ceiling and ornamental walls restored to its original design, while seating is now reconfigurable for different events, including 650 seats that can be removed to create more standing room space (like for Smith’s concert). More importantly, city officials hope the re-opening of the Castro Theatre will also help revive the predominantly queer neighborhood it sits in, which shares a name with the venerable venue.

ALSO AVAILABLE Castro Theatre Tickets on Vivid Seats FIND TICKETS HERE Smith’s residency runs until March 14. According to tourism officials and local businesses, Smith’s new Castro residency and the reopening of the theatre has already helped to bring in a number of new visitors to the area. Mat Schuster, the executive chef and owner of long-time neighborhood fixture, Canela, says business has been “very busy” in the last few weeks, crediting Smith’s show with bringing out new diners to the Spanish restaurant, which has been on Market Street since 2011. Other local hotspots like wine bar Bar49, the San Francisco outpost of Hi Tops, and the women’s sports bar, Rikki’s (named after Gay Games Federation founder Rikki Streicher), were all packed on a recent evening following Smith’s Castro concert. According to San Francisco Tourism, the reopening of The Castro Theatre is poised to deliver “meaningful economic gains” to the surrounding neighborhood, which some stats estimating that the venue will draw more than 200,000 visitors annually. With the Castro Theatre now open again, local officials are looking ahead to other upcoming celebrations, including a planned reimagining of the Castro and Market Street intersection into The Memorial at Harvey Milk Plaza, honoring the first openly gay elected official in California (and the inspiration for the 2009 Sean Penn film ). Milk’s legacy is already enshrined at the San Francisco airport of course, with terminal 1 at SFO renamed as the “Harvey Milk Terminal;” the new memorial is scheduled to be completed by 2028. The annual Castro Street Fair, meantime, a community street celebration founded by Harvey Milk in 1974, will take place on the first weekend of October. The reopening of the Castro comes amidst a busy few months for San Francisco, which recently saw a number of athletes and celebrities in town for the Super Bowl . Steph Curry’s new speakeasy, The Eighth Rule, was among the hotspots over the big game weekend and the basketball star’s bourbon-forward bar continues to be a hot reservation in the city. Opened in the fall, the bar is tucked away in a nondescript hallway inside the Westin St. Francis hotel in Union Square, offering an intimate and exclusive setting for the Golden State Warriors point guard’s Gentleman’s Cut Bourbon , which can be ordered on its own or as part of a six-course omakase-style cocktail tasting (we loved the clarified coconut milk punch and the truffle-vanilla whiskey sour). Of course, guests can also order cocktails a la carte, choosing from different bourbons and whiskeys, plus a full selection of other spirits. Next door to The Eighth Rule is Bourbon Steak San Francisco, the latest outpost of Chef Michael Mina’s award-winning steakhouse. The restaurant marks the celebrity chef’s return to the Westin St. Francis, where he opened his first eponymous restaurant in 2004. In addition to its selection of steaks, seafood and caviar offerings (like Mina’s famous “caviar twinkee”), this Bourbon Steak outpost offers a family-style dining experience for six people, available through advance reservations. This is the only Bourbon Steak location to offer this communal table format. New this month is the highly-anticipated opening of JouJou, an elevated French brasserie concept from the owners of the two Michelin-starred Lazy Bear. Located in the city’s Design District, JouJou is poised to be the next celebrity hangout, with its ornate dining room and marble-topped counters setting the scene for steak frites and star sightings alike. As chef David Barzelay told the San Francisco Chronicle when asked about the inspiration for JouJou: “It always feels like you’re just in a place where it’s happening.” THR",0,2026-03-01 09:37:57

Jordan playing twins Smoke and Stack in 'Sinners.' Warner Bros. S inners dominated the 2026 NAACP Image Awards on Saturday, winning 13 awards after scoring a leading 18 nominations, including best motion picture. Additionally, star Michael B. Jordan took home the NAACP Image Awards’ top honor of entertainer of the year. The Ryan Coogler-written and -directed film, which scored a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations, racked up 10 awards across various non-televised ceremonies earlier this week. During Saturday’s broadcast ceremony, airing live on BET and CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Sinners picked up three more, for best motion picture, best actor (Michael B. Jordan) and breakthrough performer (Miles Caton). Related Stories Movies PGA Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies Delroy Lindo Speaks Out on BAFTA Tourette's Incident at NAACP Image Awards: ""Something Negative Becoming Positive"" Accepting for best motion picture, Coogler praised the audience for “wrapping [their] arms around the movie” and shouted out Warner Bros. Pictures co-chairs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy for believing in the film and encouraged them to stand in the audience. Coogler ended his speech with powerful comments about representation and identity. “Since our people been here over four centuries, there’s always been a lot of lies told about us,” he said. “And a lie, no matter how powerful the person saying it is, is still a lie and the truth, no matter how little power the person saying it has, is still the truth, and the truth is y’all are loved, y’all are beautiful and y’all are powerful and mighty. And bless y’all. Thank y’all so much.” Accepting his best actor award, Jordan spoke about what the NAACP Image Awards means to him and dedicated the trophy to his late friend and co-star Chadwick Boseman. “Y’all really don’t understand how much this means to me, being here. I used to come here when I was a kid, when I was about 15 years old, sneaking in through the back as best I could,” Jordan said. “This is a place where I always felt encouraged, always felt like I was being celebrated and nourished. … You told me it was OK to keep going because I felt seen here, I felt comfortable, I felt the love. That’s why I love being here, and I love you guys so much. And I was thinking about lead actor, and I was thinking about what lead actor meant to me, and, honestly, I’ve got to dedicate this award to Chadwick Boseman.” In closing, he said, “I love being Black. I love y’all.” Stars Jordan and Delroy Lindo , who were presenting an award onstage at the BAFTA Awards in London on Sunday when a guest with Tourette Syndrome could be heard shouting the N-word, also received support from presenters and the audience at the ceremony. Taking the stage with Coogler a little over an hour into the ceremony, Lindo, who won the NAACP Image Award for best supporting actor for his role in Sinners earlier this week, offered some of his first public comments on the incident. “I’d just like to officially say, I appreciate, we appreciate all the support and love we have been shown in the aftermath of what happened last weekend. It means a lot to us,” he said. He added the moment is a “classic case of something that could be very negative becoming very positive” and reflected on the “honor” of being at the NAACP Image Awards . BAFTA has since offered a full apology for the incident , which reached a wider audience when it aired during the BBC broadcast of the awards show, and vowed to launch a “comprehensive review” of the ceremony. Earlier, presenter Regina Hall and best actress in a comedy series winner Quinta Brunson offered their support for Sinners and host Deon Cole joked about the incident. Presenting the first award of the evening, to Caton, Hall took a moment to recognize “kings” Jordan and Lindo for their “class,” comments that led to a standing ovation. Brunson also offered a shoutout to the cast and crew of Sinners . “We see you,” she said. “We’re behind you … love you.” During a segment in his monologue listing humorous prayers for Teyana Taylor, 50 Cent and Nicki Minaj (who Cole said has been “going through a lot lately and hasn’t been herself”), Cole offered a prayer for anyone in the audience with Tourette’s to “read the room.” Other top winners Saturday night included Cynthia Erivo (best actress in a motion picture for Wicked: For Good ) and best drama actor and actress winners Sterling K. Brown ( Paradise ) and Angela Bassett ( 9-1-1 ). While Bassett and Erivo weren’t in attendance, Brown offered some charged comments about the Trump administration’s policies in his acceptance speech. “We are living under an administration that has an attack on diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, is trying to erase critical race theory but they can’t erase us because, as [earlier presenter] Sam[uel L. Jackson] said, ‘There’s no America without us,'” Brown said. Saturday’s awards took place just hours after the U.S. and Israel launched attacks on Iran, in which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed. But the Iran strikes weren’t mentioned during the ceremony. Still, host Cole’s monologue included some critical remarks about Trump, ICE and Trump supporter Nicki Minaj. As Cole took the stage, he called the event the “Trump image awards,” joking, “we had to do that.” He continued of the president, who has added his name to the Kennedy Center and reportedly wants it added to other facilities like Washington’s Dulles International Airport and New York’s Penn Station, “He wants his name on everything. If we didn’t do that, we’d go to commercial and come back to a rerun of Matlock .” As for ICE, Cole asked for permission to curse and, in remarks that were bleeped for the television audience but were greeted with a great deal of applause in the room, appeared to say, “Fuck ICE.” “I don’t want to see no ICE ever again,” he said, joking that he took guests like Ice Cube and Ice Spice off the guest list and couldn’t watch the Winter Olympics because there was too much ice. Special honorees recognized Saturday night include Chairman’s Award recipient Viola Davis and President’s Award recipient Colman Domingo. Additionally, Salt-n-Pepa and DJ Spinderella were inducted into the NAACP Image Awards’ Hall of Fame. The ceremony also paid tribute to the late Rev. Jesse Jackson, with NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson honoring the late civil rights activist, whose family was in attendance at the ceremony. “He worked to open the eyes of those who could not see and give hope to those without it,” Johnson said. Samuel L. Jackson spoke about how the leader who shared his last name “inspired” him and others who have spoken out and protested. “Even though we can no longer hear his voice, when we see a wrong we can ask ourselves, ‘What would Jesse do?'” Jesse Jackson, Samuel L. Jackson said, made him realize “I am somebody,” referencing one of Jesse Jackson’s most famous quotes. After the audience joined him on “somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson led the crowd in the affirmation. “Reverend Jackson, because of you, we are somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson added. “Power to the people!” Prior to Saturday night’s broadcast ceremony, numerous winners were already revealed in non-televised ceremonies earlier this week, including virtual ceremonies on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. In the virtual ceremonies, Michelle Obama, Will Packer and Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show were among the winners on night one . Lamar, SZA and Cardi B were among the night two winners . And Sinners, Gracie’s Corner, Ironheart, Celebrity Family Feud and Straw were among the multiple award winners on night three .

Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET Viola Davis delivered a powerful speech at the 2026 NAACP Image Awards on Saturday night, where she reflected on her early beginnings, success in the industry and the current state of the nation. The EGOT winner was honored with the Chairman’s Award, hitting the stage on Saturday and beginning her acceptance speech by noting, “I always feel like I’m going to step into feeling like I deserve it.” “I like this quote, that the definition of hell is on your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person that you could have become,” she continued. “I say that about our nation, I say that about myself; that there is no becoming until you face the depth and the darkness of your own soul. There is no becoming without healing and without a radical acceptance of one’s truth. I know that about myself growing up in poverty.” Related Stories Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies Leonardo DiCaprio to Miss Actor Awards Due to Filming Martin Scorsese's 'What Happens at Night' The Woman King actress reflected on her upbringing, noting, “Little chocolate girl with thick lips and wide nose in Rhode Island in 1965. I didn’t see hope. I didn’t see dreams. I just wanted to be somebody. I wanted success because I thought it was significance. And no one can describe the journey of going from the little chocolate girl searching for hope, searching for God, and the girl living a transcendent life.” “That is a hero’s journey, and we have only to follow the thread of a hero’s path. And where we had thought we would find an abomination, we shall find a God. And where we thought that we could slay the other, we will slay ourselves. And where we had thought to journey outwards, we shall come to the center of our own existence,” Davis added. “And where we had thought to be alone, we shall come to be with all the world. There is no soul of a nation without the soul of its people. And the soul of its people is not just who is represented in the breathing and alive people in this room, but by all those who are no longer here. We either move forward together or not at all. There is no man behind the curtain who has control over your life.” “Our crown has already been bought and paid for,” she said. “All we have to do is wear it.” Davis went on to commend “the people that we forget, the people don’t that we don’t think about, the work that we don’t want to do,” sharing praise for “the people working at the food pantry in Central Falls feeding 3,000 people a month, the people who are caring for my mother who’s in advanced dementia.” “You are my hero.

But the big question going into British music’s biggest awards ceremony was, would the awards themselves need a similar name change? Well, let’s just call them the Olivias, shall we? Dean – who, with her Grammy win for Best New Artist has become a focal point for the British music resurgence – picked up four of the five awards she was up for: Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Pop Act and a share of Song of the Year for her duet with Sam Fender on “Rein Me In.” She also pulled off one of the performances of the night with a delightfully breezy “Man I Need,” embodying her old school mainstream appeal. Popular on Variety Related Stories Series Creators Push Back as the Industry Gets ‘Nervous’ About Important Stories and Female Perspective: ‘The Content Might Be Different Enough to Actually Make a Difference’ 'Bridgerton' Stars Hannah Dodd, Masali Baduza and Victor Alli on Francesca's Unlikely Romance and That Shocking Death And, while Charli xcx, Raye and Harry Styles have similarly dominated Britain’s leading awards ceremony in recent years, Dean’s success was all the more meaningful because this was no walkover. She faced meaningful opposition from equally worthy potential winners in every category, with genuine global U.K. success stories suddenly seemingly everywhere. Perhaps that’s why her multiple tearful acceptance speeches all seemed charmingly overwhelmed to the point of befuddlement, barely mustering a quote of note between them (“This album is just about love, and loving each other in a world that feels loveless right now,” was about as headline-grabbing as it got). No matter: plenty of other people stepped up on that front. This was a vintage Brits, packed full of talking points, incidents and a general air of unpredictability in a way we haven’t seen since the peak Britpop era in the mid-‘90s. Returning superstar Harry Styles kicked things off with a bang via a bravura performance of “Aperture” from his hotly anticipated “Kiss All the Time, Disco Occasionally” album, which comes out this Friday. Raye went full James Bond theme with a brassy combo of “Where Is My Husband?” and “Nightingale Lane.” And Wolf Alice marked their transition from plucky indie types to full-on rock stars with a stunning acoustic version of “The Sofa,” set in a living room, that ended with frontwoman Ellie Rowsell lifted high by her backing dancers. The band also picked up Group of the Year, with Rowsell speaking up for better support for grassroots venues and artists themselves, declaring: “This shouldn’t feel like a golden ticket, but a viable career decision.” In recent years, the Brits have relied heavily on international artists to provide the star power, but overall this year’s contingent were rather more mundane. An exception was International Artist of the Year winner Rosalía, who provided some edge with a dramatic take on “Berghain” that featured an attention-grabbing appearance from Björk; Rosalía also did a surprisingly good Liam Gallagher impression in a chat with host Jack Whitehall. But Alex Warren’s performance of “Ordinary” lived up to its name, despite the presence of James Blunt on piano (“James Blunt without a microphone – everyone’s a winner,” quipped Whitehall); the KPop Demon Hunters performance was pre-recorded so failed to connect in the room; Sombr’s obviously staged altercation with a pretend-stage-invader barely registered in a cynical industry section that has seen plenty of actual Brits stage invasions over the years. More authentic controversy came from Whitehall in trademark near-the-knuckle form, with his jokes about the Epstein files being censored from the live broadcast (notably “I think that I saw Peter Mandelson on the guest list,” referencing the former ambassador to the U.S. who was arrested in connection with the files). He also goaded Happy Mondays legends Shaun Ryder and Bez into making slanderous remarks about Paddington Bear, while Geese bassist Max Bassin declared, “Free Palestine, fuck ICE” as he picked up the International Group of the Year award, and Noel Gallagher concluded his Best Songwriter acceptance speech with “Up the fucking Blues” — a Manchester City soccer reference that brought forth an avalanche of boos (with half of Manchester supporting the other Manchester team, United). But, really, tonight was about British music regaining its confidence to the point where you wondered if some of those international slots might better have gone to U.K. stars. Breakthrough Artist winner Lola Young performed “Messy” at last year’s ceremony, but surely deserved a return, while Lily Allen – maker of “West End Girl,” the most talked-about album of the year and one of the best – sadly did not perform, despite rumors she was in negotiations for a slot. This embarrassment of riches not only elevated the TV spectacle, but also the atmosphere in the Co-op Live Arena (which has successfully bounced back from its disastrous opening in 2024). The buzz around the awards eased its potentially tricky transition to Manchester, with the industry turning out in force. There was a strong “school trip” atmosphere on the various specially chartered trains up from Manchester – something you don’t get on the tube to the O2 – and a strong international presence: UMG EVP Andrew Kronfeld, Republic Records’ co-founder Monte Lipman, Warner Records co-chairman Tom Corson and Sony Music boss Rob Stringer (fresh from watching his beloved Luton Town soccer club play at nearby Port Vale in the afternoon) were among those spotted in the city or on the arena floor, as well as U.K. presidents and CEOs Dickon Stainer (Universal), Jason Iley (Sony), Jo Charrington (Capitol), Louis Bloom (Island EMI Label Group), Ben Mortimer (Polydor Label Group), Tom Lewis (Fontana) and Dipesh Parmar (Columbia), plus a remarkably chilled-looking Stacey Tang, RCA U.K. co-president and this year’s BRITs chair/showrunner. And there was also a real buzz across the city in the nights before, with Universal Music holding a spectacular showcase at the Aviva Studios, featuring Simon Cowell’s new boyband December 10, plus Flo and Holly Humberstone; Island Records putting on new acts Keo, Dermot Henry and Sinéad Ashiokai at Yes; and underplay shows from the likes of Olivia Dean, the Foo Fighters and Robbie Williams. Williams also featured at the Awards, fronting the tribute to Ozzy Osbourne that accompanied Ozzy’s posthumous Lifetime Achievement award. Williams was hand-picked by Sharon Osbourne, who paid emotional tribute to her “gorgeous husband”, declaring, “There will never be another fucking Ozzy Osbourne.” But the Prince of Darkness being portrayed by the King of Light Entertainment on a version of “No More Tears” still raised plenty of eyebrows. It shouldn’t have worked – and it didn’t really, despite the best efforts of the band, featuring many musicians that played with Osbourne over the years. Thankfully, a tide of emotion carried things through, with more poignant notes struck as the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess paid tribute to one of Manchester’s favorite sons, Gary “Mani” Mounfield of the Stone Roses and Primal Scream. Outstanding Contribution winner Mark Ronson also remembered his former musical partner Amy Winehouse in both his speech (“The music I made with Amy is the reason other people know who I am”) and his performance, which featured Winehouse’s voice, first hauntingly on “Back to Black” and then joyously, on “Valerie.” Ronson was also joined by Ghostface Killah and Dua Lipa, in full show-stopping mode, in one of the night’s highlights. Another rock legend, Noel Gallagher – a local lad and the man behind 2025’s biggest UK cultural moment in the form of the Oasis reunion tour – somewhat controversially picked up the Songwriter Of The Year award: the fourth time in the awards’ five-year history that it’s gone to someone best known as an artist (and, in this case, one who gladly admitted he hasn’t actually written a song in two years). Perhaps that was why Gallagher was relatively self-deprecating in his acceptance speech, paying tribute to his brother and band members. “They brought these songs to life – without them, I’d just be a singer-songwriter and no one gives a shit about singer-songwriters”. The success of Dean and Fender – who also picked up the Alternative/Rock Act prize – might suggest otherwise. But, as the biz drifted off to the after show parties – which also made the trip north, with Sony Music taking over Soho House and Warner Music partying hard at the Cut & Craft – it was obvious the Brits 2026 had been – as its principle winner might sing – the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life. Which should, hopefully, make it easy to fall in love with British music all over again.

The Spring 2026 campaign is the first in a series of inspired by Hilfiger’s favorite destinations around the world. This particular aesthetic takes inspiration from Hilfiger’s Palm Beach home. Schwarzenegger and Champion are photographed against classic Cadillacs and pool side loungers. In a release for the campaign, Hilfiger describes building the brand with “endless curiosity, a belief in dreaming big and a love of bringing people together” over the last 40 years. “From the beginning, I looked to the creative voices shaping pop culture to help guide that vision,” he said. “This season, we’ve invited a cross-generation cast of icons and contemporary voices to the ultimate Spring party — to share in the way I live,” Hilfiger continued. “It’s a celebration alive with personality and modern American style.” Abby Champion for Tommy Hilfiger. Lachlan Bailey Schwarzenegger described Hilfiger as “the ultimate host,” noting his knack for curating an exciting group of people. “There’s something about the way he brings people together,” Champion added in a release. “You never know who’s going to arrive or what the night will turn into.

Jordan and Delroy Lindo some love following an incident at last weekend’s BAFTA Awards. During the international ceremony, the BBC broadcast an outburst from a Tourette’s campaigner that included a racial slur, which was uttered while the actors were on stage. While presenting the first award of the NAACP ceremony on Saturday, “One Battle After Another” star Regina Hall asked the audience to “take a moment for the two kings who are in this audience,” gesturing toward Jordan and Lindo seated inside the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where the awards ceremony is being held.

Popular on Variety The BAFTA incident has dominated headlines for the past week, as representatives for BAFTA and John Davidson, the Tourette syndrome campaigner at the center of the controversy, issued statements and apologies . In an exclusive interview with Variety , Davidson said he “felt a wave of shame” in the moment he realized the crowd could hear his involuntary tics and questioned why he was seated so close to a microphone. However, further questions about why the BBC aired the moment in a tape-delayed broadcast — and after “Sinners” studio Warner Bros. requested for the moment to be edited out — continue to keep the situation in the news. Hall’s call for the impromptu ovation followed a pointed joke by comedian Deon Cole, who returned as host of the Image Awards telecast. Cole framed his opening monologue like a prayer, with jokes about Teyana Taylor’s relationship status, 50 Cent’s pettiness and Nicki Minaj’s politics. Cole finished the bit by saying, “Lord, if there are any white men out here in the audience with Tourette’s, I advise you to tell them they better read the room tonight.” After Hall and Cole’s shoutouts, “Abbott Elementary” star Quinta Brunson — who won the NAACP Image Award for outstanding actress in a comedy series — also took a moment to celebrate the “Sinners” cast and crew. “We see you. We are behind you,” Brunson said. “We support you, and we love you.” Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” is the most-nominated project at this year’s Image Awards, with Jordan also vying for the Entertainer of the Year prize. Later in the ceremony, LIndo took the stage to present an award with “Sinners” filmmaker Ryan Coogler, welcomed by another standing ovation. “Before we start, I’d just like to officially say, we appreciate — I appreciate — we appreciate all the support and the love that we have been shown in the aftermath of what happened last weekend. It means a lot to us,” Lindo began, while the crowd clapped and cheered. Ryan Coogler and Delroy Lindo speak onstage during the 57th NAACP Image Awards. Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET “It is an honor to be here amongst our people this evening,” he continued. “Among so many people who have shown us such incredible support. And it’s a classic case of something that could be very negative becoming very positive.” Coogler, too, acknowledged the importance of being among the Black community at the Image Awards. “There’s something powerful about standing in this room — a room where we don’t have to explain ourselves, or our stories aren’t footnotes,” he said. “They’re the main text.” “A room where being fully seen is not rare, it is expected,” Lindo chimed in, as the two began to trade lines of the presenters’ copy. “And that matters, because so much of what we do on screen and behind the scenes is about fighting to be understood,” Coogler continued, as Lindo added: “To be layered. Complex. To be human.” “Nights like this remind us that when we tell our stories truthfully, we show up as we are. We create space for each other,” Coogler said. “Space to grow. Space to lead. Space to shine,” Lindo said. “So it’s an honor to stand here together, not just as collaborators, not just as Oakland residents,” Coogler quipped, never missing a moment to shout out his Bay Area roots. “But as part of a community that continues to move culture forward.” Just a few minutes later, Jordan took the stage to accept the award for outstanding lead actor and reflected on why he’s always placed importance on attending the Image Awards — even going so far as sneaking in earlier in his career. “Man, I love being Black,” he declared, raising the trophy triumphantly.

Popular on Variety “Sinners” star Jordan, who won both Entertainer of the Year and outstanding actor in a motion picture, dedicated his lead actor trophy to his “Black Panther” co-star Chadwick Boseman, who died at the age of 43 in 2020. “I was thinking about what ‘lead actor’ meant to me. And honestly, I gotta dedicate this award to Chadwick Boseman,” Jordan said on stage. “As my brother, our time on this planet is short. I was watching the ‘In Memoriam’ and seeing how fast these careers go by and people’s lives go by, and what we do while we’re here on Earth. And I just want to be here and be present with you guys as much as possible.” “Sinners” cast and filmmakers — Ludwig Göransson, Ryan Coogler, Zinzi Coogler, Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Mosaku, Michael B. Jordan (also winner of the Entertainer of the Year award), Miles Caton, Jayme Lawson and Sev Ohanian — pose in the press room during the 57th NAACP Image Awards.

Jackson also led a powerful tribute to the late Civil Rights leader Jesse Jackson. Davis, the recipient of this year’s Chairman’s Award, said in her acceptance speech, “I like this quote that the definition of hell is, ‘On your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person that you could have become.’ I say that about our nation, I say that about myself — that there is no becoming until you face the depth and the darkness of your own soul. There is no becoming without healing and without a radical acceptance of one’s truth.” See the winners list below. Entertainer of the Year Michael B.

According to Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office records, LaBeouf was taken into custody Saturday and charged with one additional misdemeanor count of simple battery. The Transformers star’s attorney, Sarah Chervinsky, said that after learning New Orleans police had issued a new arrest warrant Friday, LaBeouf voluntarily turned himself in to the Orleans Parish jail, according to the Associated Press . “No regular person would be required to post over $100,000 in bonds and be jailed two separate times for one misdemeanor incident,” Chervinsky said. “Just as he does not deserve preferential treatment, Mr. LaBeouf also does not deserve to be treated more harshly by the police and courts just because he is a public figure.” Related Stories General News Who Won and Lost the Week: The Great Netflix Pull-Out Edition (Plus Tyra, Shia and More) News Shia LaBeouf to Remain Free on $100,000 Bail After New Orleans Bar Altercation The legal trouble began during Mardi Gras earlier this month. LaBeouf was arrested Feb. 17 following an altercation at R Bar in the Faubourg Marigny. Authorities said he became aggressive and allegedly fought with two men, both of whom told police he assaulted them. LaBeouf is accused of punching one bartender multiple times and striking another in the face. He also allegedly shouted homophobic slurs during the incident. The Hollywood Reporter reported details of the altercation at the time. LaBeouf was later taken to a local hospital for undisclosed injuries. After being released, he was formally charged with two counts of simple battery. In an interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan released Saturday morning, the 39-year-old actor addressed what he said led to his initial arrest and discussed his recent behavior. “It’s not nice to hurt people ever. It’s fucking lame. People got hurt. I got to deal with that. I’mma deal with that in full. I’ll eat it all,” he said. “It was on me. It’s not on them. It’s on me. I messed up.” When asked if he takes responsibility, LaBeouf responded, “Definitely. Yeah. 1,000 percent.” He added, “My side is this — my behavior, bullshit. I got to deal with that. Does that mean I got to go to rehab again? I’m just not into it, bro. I don’t think my answers are there. If I genuinely did, I’d go. I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I think I have a different problem, and I’m going to address it.” The Fury actor said he believes he has a “small man complex,” explaining, “I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more so than my drinking. That’s where I’m at now on my journey, and I’m trying to navigate it.” When asked what triggered his anger, LaBeouf said, “I’ll be honest with you, big gay people are scary to me. I’m standing by myself, and three gay dudes are next to me, touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry if that’s homophobic. Then I’m that.” Asked whether that situation happens often, he said it occurred only once. “That’s why I got arrested,” he said. LaBeouf concluded, “I am wrong for touching anyone, ever. And that’s the end of my statement on this whole shit.” THR",0,2026-03-01 09:38:02
