Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET At the end of the week that saw the 2026 BAFTA Awards descend into controversy after guest John Davidson, who has Tourette Syndrome, shouted the N-word while Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented an award, the 2026 NAACP Image Awards offered numerous opportunities for those affected by the incident to express their support for Jordan and Lindo. And Lindo himself offered his first public comments on the incident, taking the stage with his Sinners writer-director Ryan Coogler a little over an hour into the ceremony to loud applause at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.

It means a lot to us,” Lindo said. He added the moment is a “classic case of something that could be very negative becoming very positive” and reflected on the “honor” of being at the NAACP Image Awards . BAFTA has since offered a full apology for the incident , which reached a wider audience when it aired during the BBC broadcast of the awards show, and vowed to launch a “comprehensive review” of the ceremony. Earlier during Saturday’s NAACP Image Awards, which aired live on CBS and BET, host Deon Cole jokingly offered a prayer for anyone in the audience with Tourette’s to “read the room.” Later, presenting the first award of the evening, to Sinners ‘ Miles Caton, Regina Hall took a moment to recognize “kings” Jordan and Lindo for their “class,” comments that led to a standing ovation. Abbott Elementary star and creator Quinta Brunson, winning the second award of the evening for best actress in a comedy series, also offered a shoutout to the cast and crew of Sinners . “We see you,” she said. “We’re behind you … love you.” Sinners led this year’s NAACP Image Awards nominations with 18 nods and had won nine of those by the time Coogler and Lindo took the stage. Afterward, the film won two more, including best actor (Michael B. Jordan) and best motion picture, bringing its total to 11. THR",0,2026-03-01 02:59:36

Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET Viola Davis delivered a powerful speech at the 2026 NAACP Image Awards on Saturday night, where she reflected on her early beginnings, success in the industry and the current state of the nation. The EGOT winner was honored with the Chairman’s Award, hitting the stage on Saturday and beginning her acceptance speech by noting, “I always feel like I’m going to step into feeling like I deserve it.” “I like this quote, that the definition of hell is on your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person that you could have become,” she continued. “I say that about our nation, I say that about myself; that there is no becoming until you face the depth and the darkness of your own soul. There is no becoming without healing, and without a radical acceptance of one’s truth. I know that about myself growing up in poverty.” Related Stories Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies Leonardo DiCaprio to Miss Actor Awards Due to Filming Martin Scorsese's 'What Happens at Night' The Woman King actress reflected on her upbringing, noting, “Little chocolate girl with thick lips and wide nose in Rhode Island in 1965. I didn’t see hope. I didn’t see dreams. I just wanted to be somebody. I wanted success because I thought it was significance. And no one can describe the journey of going from the little chocolate girl searching for hope, searching for God, and the girl living a transcendent life.” “That is a hero’s journey, and we have only to follow the thread of a hero’s path. And where we had thought we would find an abomination, we shall find a God. And where we thought that we could slay the other, we will slay ourselves. And where we had thought to journey outwards, we shall come to the center of our own existence,” Davis added. “And where we had thought to be alone, we shall come to be with all the world. There is no soul of a nation without the soul of its people. And the soul of its people is not just who is represented in the breathing and alive people in this room, but by all those who are no longer here. We either move forward together or not at all. There is no man behind the curtain who has a control over your life.” “Our crown has already been bought and paid for,” she said. “All we have to do is wear it.” Davis went on to commend “the people that we forget, the people don’t that we don’t think about, the work that we don’t want to do,” sharing praise for “the people working at the food pantry in Central Falls feeding 3000 people a month, the people who are caring for my mother who’s in advanced dementia, caring for the least of these.” “You are my hero. I see you,” she concluded. “Thank you.” Saturday night, Colman Domingo additionally received the President’s Award, while Salt-n-Pepa and DJ Spinderella were set to be inducted into the NAACP Image Awards ’ Hall of Fame. Ahead of the televised awards show, a slew of winners were unveiled earlier this week. Michelle Obama, Will Packer and Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show each won big during night one ; Lamar, SZA and Cardi B took home awards during night two ; and Sinners, Gracie’s Corner, Ironheart, Celebrity Family Feud and Straw acquired victories on night three .

Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Shia LaBeouf has once again been arrested, this time on an additional charge of misdemeanor count of simple battery related to an incident earlier this month in which he assaulted several people in New Orleans, per the Associated Press . The actor was previously booked and posted bail in the aftermath of the Feb. 17 bar brawl , in which he punched patrons and shouted anti-gay slurs. The Transformers alum now faces three charges, with his next hearing scheduled for March 19. City police previously said LaBeouf was “causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive” at a Royal Street business outside the French Quarter. LaBeouf’s attorney Sarah Chervinsky told the AP that LaBeouf voluntarily turned himself in to the Orleans Parish Prison upon learning of the new arrest warrant issued yesterday. Watch on Deadline Related Stories News Shia LaBeouf Posts ""Free Me"" After Being Arrested At Mardi Gras Party Legal Shia LaBeouf And FKA Twigs Settle Sexual Battery Suit - Update “No regular person would be required to post over $100,000 in bonds, and be jailed two separate times for one misdemeanor incident,” Chervinsky said. “Just as he does not deserve preferential treatment, Mr. LaBeouf also does not deserve to be treated more harshly by the police and courts just because he is a public figure.” The news comes amid LaBeouf’s sprawling interview with Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan , during which he rambled about his past legal issues, sobriety journey, religious beliefs and former relationships with artist FKA Twigs and actress Mia Goth. At one point, he left the interview couch to grab a beer and, toward the conclusion of the conversation, walked away and accidentally broke his wall. “I fucked up, it’s on me,” he said of the New Orleans arrest. “It was no good, bro. My behavior’s dirty, ugly, disgusting, so I gotta eat it, you know?” LaBeouf also posited he may still be charged with a hate crime, which carries a more severe penalty, though in some statements he expressed a cavalier attitude toward his latest controversy. “Who gives a fuck though? It’s another experience. Jail be another adventure. What are you gonna do?” he said. Despite having attended support groups for addiction previously, he said, “I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I think I have a different problem, and I’m gonna address it … I think I have a small man complex. Some kind of Napoleonic, I don’t know what it is. I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more than my drinking.” He added that he has often been “forced to get sober by the court system, usually, and then women get scared, so you gotta stay sober for the girl.” In more eyebrow-raising comments, he admitted his bigotry is “why I got arrested.” “Big, gay people are scary to me,” he said, saying that when three gay men “are touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry. If that’s homophobic, then I’m that.” He said he gets triggered when his “masculinity is challenged,” adding, “I’m good with gay, be gay over there though, don’t be gay in my lap.” Later, he pivoted: “I am wrong for touching anyone ever and that’s the end of my statement on this whole shit.” LaBeouf also confirmed that once released from jail (he said he didn’t know who bailed him out), he returned to party in the French Quarter during Mardi Gras. This isn’t the first time the Disturbia actor has been embroiled in unsavory dealings. The former child star-turned-embattled figure was previously sued by ex-girlfriend Twigs for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, which was later settled . Of that matter, he admitted to Callaghan: “Whatever she said, run with most of it.” Paramount And WBD Reveal Details Of $110B Deal: Latest News + Analysis ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Sinners’ ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Win: Full List On The Set Of The ‘Peaky Blinders’ Movie With Cillian Murphy & The Rest Of The Gang Read More About: Comments",0,2026-03-01 02:59:08

The news comes hours after Donald Trump proclaimed the harsh 37-year rule of the cleric had ended with the US and Israeli attack on Iran . With dozens of other members of the Iranian leadership also dead, Khamenei was said to have died in his official office in the early hours of the first wave of attacks on Iran by US and Israeli air forces. “The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution was martyred at their workplace in the Leader’s Residence,” official Iranian media tweeted just minutes ago.. “At the moment of martyrdom, they were carrying out their assigned duties and present at their workplace (their office), and this cowardly attack occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning.” Related Stories News U.S. And Israel Launch Strikes On Iran; Trump Says Reports Of Iran Supreme Leader's Death Are ""Correct"" - Update News Brit Awards Host Jack Whitehall Takes Jab At BAFTAs Over Racial Slur Incident: ""We've Got The Best In The Business On The Bleep Button"" As the Islamic Republic uncharacteristically quickly acknowledged Khamenei’s death, no successor has been announced. Added to that, with celebrations breaking out in Iran following weeks of massive protests against the regime, Israel has launched a series of new strikes on Iran. Watch on Deadline News of the official confirmation of Khamenei’s killing spread within seconds online and on cable news, which has been covering the situation in Iran and the region wall-to-wall since late last Friday. Trump said today that this weekend’s Operation Epic Fury barrage was just the start of a “massive and ongoing” operation of regime change and to end Iran’s long running nuclear program. To that, U.S. Central Command posted a missile strike video just as news of Khamenei’s death was revealed with tears and promises of 40 days of mourning in Iran. The Iranian regime was warned. CENTCOM is now delivering swift and decisive action as directed. pic.twitter.com/nNDoDexH6g — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) March 1, 2026 PREVIOUSLY, 2:04 PM: Iran’s Supreme Leader is dead, Donald Trump has proclaimed in a lengthy social media post. However, under bombardment from American and Israeli forces, the Iranian government still insists Ali Khamenei is alive, though no one has seen the much-feared cleric in days. “Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote this afternoon at 1:37 p.m. PT. As the BBC noted soon after the openly regime-change-seeking Trump posted, there has still been “no independent verification” of Khamenei’s death. Iranian State media is saying, as it has been all day, that the 86-year-old Khamenei is alive. Just before Trump posted, Khamenei’s own X feed put up a defiant image of a sword-wielding figure and more Shia warrior symbolism. به نام نامی حیدر علیه‌السلام pic.twitter.com/n848j6KASq — KHAMENEI.IR | فارسی (@Khamenei_fa) February 28, 2026 At the same time, as American and Israeli forces once again attempted to halt Iran’s nuclear program, satellite images show the top cleric’s residence was destroyed in Operation Epic Fury. Also, publicly unveiled plans for Khamenei to address the Islamic Republic were shelved. Still, with no solid word of what the state of the murderous Revolutionary Guard and the Iranian military are and who they are backing, Trump had no such caution about the Iranian leader’s future in his own post. “This is not only Justice for the people of Iran, but for all Great Americans, and those people from many Countries throughout the World, that have been killed or mutilated by Khamenei and his gang of bloodthirsty THUGS,” POTUS added from his Mar-a-lago estate in Florida With rumors of the fate of Khamenei, who has ruled Iran since 1989, swirling in the hours after the first attacks on Tehran, cable news outlets scrambled to pivot as Trump made his announcement. Broadcast networks such as CBS shuffled their programming lineups to get primetime specials on “War with Iran” on air tonight On CNN , guests like former Trump National Security Adviser, the retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who was recently named as a CBS News contributor, tried to provide instant context of what the immediate fallout could be. In American cities like Los Angeles, anti-Khamenei protesters were celebrating on the streets and online within minutes of Trump’s posting. As MS Now , the BBC, Fox News and CNN brought on their top anchors for coverage, the still-Warner Bros. Discovery-own cable net also reported that “celebrations” were taking place in Tehran over reports of Khamanei’s death. The Iranian capital, like many cities and regions in the country, has seen mass protests and mass killings by the regime over the past few months. Speaking on Israeli TV earlier Saturday, PM Benjamin Netanyahu referred to Khemenei as “no longer” in charge, a significant choice of words. Earlier Saturday, Trump spoke of Khamenei being dead, and told NBC in a phone call interview that “we feel that that is a correct story.” As various members of the Iranian elite were also said to be wiped out, Trump added: “The people that make all the decisions, most of them are gone.” In a White House-supplied photo, Donald Trump with (L-R) CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Feb. 28, 2026 in Palm Beach, Fla. At the same time as Trump posted, a United Nations Security Council meeting continued. Condemning the “hostile” U.S. and Israel for having broken international law and the U.N. charter, Iranian representatives stuck to their script and weaved away from any confirmation of Khamenei’s death. Also Saturday, Trump said the strikes on Iran, which today had fired back at U.S. bases, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and American allies in the Middle East, would go on for several more days. Exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has emerged as a possible ruler of a new Iran, also took to social media after Trump. Calling Khamenei “the bloodthirsty despot of our time,” the 65-year-old son of the last Shah, whose own brutal and bloodthirsty regime was overthrown in 1979 in the Ayatollah Khomeini-led revolution, told officials in Iran to switch sides. “This is your final opportunity to join the nation, to help ensure Iran’s stable transition to a free and prosperous future, and to take part in building that future,” the U.K.-residing Pahlavi, who has spent most of his life outside Iran, wrote. My fellow compatriots, Ali Khamenei, the bloodthirsty despot of our time, the murderer of tens of thousands of Iran’s bravest sons and daughters, has been erased from the face of history.

But the big question going into British music’s biggest awards ceremony was, would the awards themselves need a similar name change? Well, let’s just call them the Olivias, shall we? Dean – who, with her Grammy win for Best New Artist has become a focal point for the British music resurgence – picked up four of the five awards she was up for: Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Pop Act and a share of Song of the Year for her duet with Sam Fender on “Rein Me In.” She also pulled off one of the performances of the night with a delightfully breezy “Man I Need,” embodying her old school mainstream appeal. Popular on Variety Related Stories Park Chan-wook to Preside Over 79th Cannes Film Festival Jury Ed Helms and Nat Wolff Join Rachel Zegler in Comedy Drama 'She Gets It From Me' And, while Charli xcx, Raye and Harry Styles have similarly dominated Britain’s leading awards ceremony in recent years, Dean’s success was all the more meaningful because this was no walkover. She faced meaningful opposition from equally worthy potential winners in every category, with genuine global U.K. success stories suddenly seemingly everywhere. Perhaps that’s why her multiple tearful acceptance speeches all seemed charmingly overwhelmed to the point of befuddlement, barely mustering a quote of note between them (“This album is just about love, and loving each other in a world that feels loveless right now,” was about as headline-grabbing as it got). No matter: plenty of other people stepped up on that front. This was a vintage Brits, packed full of talking points, incidents and a general air of unpredictability in a way we haven’t seen since the peak Britpop era in the mid-‘90s. Returning superstar Harry Styles kicked things off with a bang via a bravura performance of “Aperture” from his hotly anticipated “Kiss All the Time, Disco Occasionally” album, which comes out this Friday. Raye went full James Bond theme with a brassy combo of “Where Is My Husband?” and “Nightingale Lane.” And Wolf Alice marked their transition from plucky indie types to full-on rock stars with a stunning acoustic version of “The Sofa,” set in a living room, that ended with frontwoman Ellie Rowsell lifted high by her backing dancers. The band also picked up Group of the Year, with Rowsell speaking up for better support for grassroots venues and artists themselves, declaring: “This shouldn’t feel like a golden ticket, but a viable career decision.” In recent years, the Brits have relied heavily on international artists to provide the star power, but overall this year’s contingent were rather more mundane. An exception was International Artist of the Year winner Rosalía, who provided some edge with a dramatic take on “Berghain” that featured an attention-grabbing appearance from Björk; Rosalía also did a surprisingly good Liam Gallagher impression in a chat with host Jack Whitehall. But Alex Warren’s performance of “Ordinary” lived up to its name, despite the presence of James Blunt on piano (“James Blunt without a microphone – everyone’s a winner,” quipped Whitehall); the KPop Demon Hunters performance was pre-recorded so failed to connect in the room; Sombr’s obviously staged altercation with a pretend-stage-invader barely registered in a cynical industry section that has seen plenty of actual Brits stage invasions over the years. More authentic controversy came from Whitehall in trademark near-the-knuckle form, with his jokes about the Epstein files being censored from the live broadcast (notably “I think that I saw Peter Mandelson on the guest list,” referencing the former ambassador to the U.S. who was arrested in connection with the files). He also goaded Happy Mondays legends Shaun Ryder and Bez into making slanderous remarks about Paddington Bear, while Geese bassist Max Bassin declared, “Free Palestine, fuck ICE” as he picked up the International Group of the Year award, and Noel Gallagher concluded his Best Songwriter acceptance speech with “Up the fucking Blues” — a Manchester City soccer reference that brought forth an avalanche of boos (with half of Manchester supporting the other Manchester team, United). But, really, tonight was about British music regaining its confidence to the point where you wondered if some of those international slots might better have gone to U.K. stars. Breakthrough Artist winner Lola Young performed “Messy” at last year’s ceremony, but surely deserved a return, while Lily Allen – maker of “West End Girl,” the most talked-about album of the year and one of the best – sadly did not perform, despite rumors she was in negotiations for a slot. This embarrassment of riches not only elevated the TV spectacle, but also the atmosphere in the Co-op Live Arena (which has successfully bounced back from its disastrous opening in 2024). The buzz around the awards eased its potentially tricky transition to Manchester, with the industry turning out in force. There was a strong “school trip” atmosphere on the various specially chartered trains up from Manchester – something you don’t get on the tube to the O2 – and a strong international presence: UMG EVP Andrew Kronfeld, Republic Records’ co-founder Monte Lipman, Warner Records co-chairman Tom Corson and Sony Music boss Rob Stringer (fresh from watching his beloved Luton Town soccer club play at nearby Port Vale in the afternoon) were among those spotted in the city or on the arena floor, as well as U.K. presidents and CEOs Dickon Stainer (Universal), Jason Iley (Sony), Jo Charrington (Capitol), Louis Bloom (Island EMI Label Group), Ben Mortimer (Polydor Label Group), Tom Lewis (Fontana) and Dipesh Parmar (Columbia), plus a remarkably chilled-looking Stacey Tang, RCA U.K. co-president and this year’s BRITs chair/showrunner. And there was also a real buzz across the city in the nights before, with Universal Music holding a spectacular showcase at the Aviva Studios, featuring Simon Cowell’s new boyband December 10, plus Flo and Holly Humberstone; Island Records putting on new acts Keo, Dermot Henry and Sinéad Ashiokai at Yes; and underplay shows from the likes of Olivia Dean, the Foo Fighters and Robbie Williams. Williams also featured at the Awards, fronting the tribute to Ozzy Osbourne that accompanied Ozzy’s posthumous Lifetime Achievement award. Williams was hand-picked by Sharon Osbourne, who paid emotional tribute to her “gorgeous husband”, declaring, “There will never be another fucking Ozzy Osbourne.” But the Prince of Darkness being portrayed by the King of Light Entertainment on a version of “No More Tears” still raised plenty of eyebrows. It shouldn’t have worked – and it didn’t really, despite the best efforts of the band, featuring many musicians that played with Osbourne over the years. Thankfully, a tide of emotion carried things through, with more poignant notes struck as the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess paid tribute to one of Manchester’s favorite sons, Gary “Mani” Mounfield of the Stone Roses and Primal Scream. Outstanding Contribution winner Mark Ronson also remembered his former musical partner Amy Winehouse in both his speech (“The music I made with Amy is the reason other people know who I am”) and his performance, which featured Winehouse’s voice, first hauntingly on “Back to Black” and then joyously, on “Valerie.” Ronson was also joined by Ghostface Killah and Dua Lipa, in full show-stopping mode, in one of the night’s highlights. Another rock legend, Noel Gallagher – a local lad and the man behind 2025’s biggest UK cultural moment in the form of the Oasis reunion tour – somewhat controversially picked up the Songwriter Of The Year award: the fourth time in the awards’ five-year history that it’s gone to someone best known as an artist (and, in this case, one who gladly admitted he hasn’t actually written a song in two years). Perhaps that was why Gallagher was relatively self-deprecating in his acceptance speech, paying tribute to his brother and band members. “They brought these songs to life – without them, I’d just be a singer-songwriter and no one gives a shit about singer-songwriters”. The success of Dean and Fender – who also picked up the Alternative/Rock Act prize – might suggest otherwise. But, as the biz drifted off to the after show parties – which also made the trip north, with Sony Music taking over Soho House and Warner Music partying hard at the Cut & Craft – it was obvious the Brits 2026 had been – as its principle winner might sing – the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life. Which should, hopefully, make it easy to fall in love with British music all over again.

The Spring 2026 campaign is the first in a series of inspired by Hilfiger’s favorite destinations around the world. This particular aesthetic takes inspiration from Hilfiger’s Palm Beach home. Schwarzenegger and Champion are photographed against classic Cadillacs and pool side loungers. In a release for the campaign, Hilfiger describes building the brand with “endless curiosity, a belief in dreaming big and a love of bringing people together” over the last 40 years. “From the beginning, I looked to the creative voices shaping pop culture to help guide that vision,” he said. “This season, we’ve invited a cross-generation cast of icons and contemporary voices to the ultimate Spring party — to share in the way I live,” Hilfiger continued. “It’s a celebration alive with personality and modern American style.” Abby Champion for Tommy Hilfiger. Lachlan Bailey Schwarzenegger described Hilfiger as “the ultimate host,” noting his knack for curating an exciting group of people. “There’s something about the way he brings people together,” Champion added in a release. “You never know who’s going to arrive or what the night will turn into.

Jordan and Delroy Lindo some love following an incident at last weekend’s BAFTA Awards. During the international ceremony, the BBC broadcast an outburst from a Tourette’s campaigner that included a racial slur, which was uttered while the actors were on stage. While presenting the first award of the NAACP ceremony on Saturday, “One Battle After Another” star Regina Hall asked the audience to “take a moment for the two kings who are in this audience,” gesturing toward Jordan and Lindo seated inside the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where the awards ceremony is being held.

Popular on Variety The BAFTA incident has dominated headlines for the past week, as representatives for BAFTA and John Davidson, the Tourette syndrome campaigner at the center of the controversy, issued statements and apologies . In an exclusive interview with Variety , Davidson said he “felt a wave of shame” in the moment he realized the crowd could hear his involuntary tics and questioned why he was seated so close to a microphone. However, further questions about why the BBC aired the moment in a tape-delayed broadcast — and after “Sinners” studio Warner Bros. requested for the moment to be edited out — continue to keep the situation in the news. Hall’s call for the impromptu ovation followed a pointed joke by comedian Deon Cole, who returned as host of the Image Awards telecast. Cole framed his opening monologue like a prayer, with jokes about Teyana Taylor’s relationship status, 50 Cent’s pettiness and Nicki Minaj’s politics. Cole finished the bit by saying, “Lord, if there are any white men out here in the audience with Tourette’s, I advise you to tell them they better read the room tonight.” After Hall and Cole’s shoutouts, “Abbott Elementary” star Quinta Brunson — who won the NAACP Image Award for outstanding actress in a comedy series — also took a moment to celebrate the “Sinners” cast and crew. “We see you. We are behind you,” Brunson said. “We support you, and we love you.” Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” is the most-nominated project at this year’s Image Awards, with Jordan also vying for the Entertainer of the Year prize. Later in the ceremony, LIndo took the stage to present an award with “Sinners” filmmaker Ryan Coogler, welcomed by another standing ovation. “Before we start, I’d just like to officially say, we appreciate — I appreciate — we appreciate all the support and the love that we have been shown in the aftermath of what happened last weekend. It means a lot to us,” Lindo began, while the crowd clapped and cheered. Ryan Coogler and Delroy Lindo speak onstage during the 57th NAACP Image Awards. Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET “It is an honor to be here amongst our people this evening,” he continued. “Among so many people who have shown us such incredible support. And it’s a classic case of something that could be very negative becoming very positive.” Coogler, too, acknowledged the importance of being among the Black community at the Image Awards. “There’s something powerful about standing in this room — a room where we don’t have to explain ourselves, or our stories aren’t footnotes,” he said. “They’re the main text.” “A room where being fully seen is not rare, it is expected,” Lindo chimed in, as the two began to trade lines of the presenters’ copy. “And that matters, because so much of what we do on screen and behind the scenes is about fighting to be understood,” Coogler continued, as Lindo added: “To be layered. Complex. To be human.” “Nights like this remind us that when we tell our stories truthfully, we show up as we are. We create space for each other,” Coogler said. “Space to grow. Space to lead. Space to shine,” Lindo said. “So it’s an honor to stand here together, not just as collaborators, not just as Oakland residents,” Coogler quipped, never missing a moment to shout out his Bay Area roots. “But as part of a community that continues to move culture forward.” Just a few minutes later, Jordan took the stage to accept the award for outstanding lead actor and reflected on why he’s always placed importance on attending the Image Awards — even going so far as sneaking in earlier in his career. “Man, I love being Black,” he declared, raising the trophy triumphantly.

The telecast, hosted by Deon Cole, caps the NAACP’s week-long celebration of Black excellence, with awards presented in more than 90 categories (across film, television and streaming, music, literature and podcasts). Ryan Coogler ’s “ Sinners ” received the most nominations with 18 nods, while “Bel-Air” led all television shows with seven nominations.

Jordan, who won outstanding actor in a motion picture for his performance in “Sinners,” dedicated his award to his late “Black Panther” co-star Chadwick Boseman. Popular on Variety “I was thinking about lead actor, and I was thinking about what lead actor meant to me. And honestly, I gotta dedicate this award to Chadwick Boseman,” Jordan said on stage. “As my brother, our time on this planet is short. I was watching the ‘In Memoriam’ and seeing how fast these careers go by and people’s lives go by, and what we do while we’re here on Earth. And I just want to be here and be present with you guys as much as possible.” During Saturday’s ceremony, special honors were presented to Viola Davis, Colman Domingo, Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Spinderella. Davis, the recipient of this year’s Chairman’s Award, said in her acceptance speech, “I like this quote that the definition of hell is, ‘On your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person that you could have become.’ I say that about our nation, I say that about myself — that there is no becoming until you face the depth and the darkness of your own soul. There is no becoming without healing and without a radical acceptance of one’s truth.” See the full winners list, updating live: Entertainer of the Year Michael B.

Deon Cole is hosting the ceremony airing live on BET and CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where winners will be announced in various categories spanning film and TV. Saturday’s awards took place just hours after the U.S. and Israel launched strikes on Iran, with President Donald Trump saying that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in the attacks. While Cole didn’t mention the Iran attacks in his monologue, he still offered timely commentary on Trump, ICE and Trump supporter Nicki Minaj. Related Stories Movies Leonardo DiCaprio to Miss Actor Awards Due to Filming Martin Scorsese's 'What Happens at Night' TV How to Watch the 2026 NAACP Image Awards Online As Cole took the stage, he called the event the “Trump image awards,” joking, “we had to do that.” He continued of the president, who has added his name to the Kennedy Center and reportedly wants it added to other facilities like Washington’s Dulles International Airport and New York’s Penn Station, “He wants his name on everything. If we didn’t do that, we’d go to commercial and come back to a rerun of Matlock .” As for ICE, Cole asked for permission to curse and, in remarks that were bleeped for the television audience but were greeted with a great deal of applause in the room, appeared to say, “Fuck ICE.” “I don’t want to see no ICE ever again,” he said, joking that he took guests like Ice Cube and Ice Spice off the guest list and couldn’t watch the Winter Olympics because there was too much ice. Cole even offered the first of multiple allusions early in the show to last Sunday’s BAFTA Awards controversy involving guest John Davidson , who has Tourette Syndrome , and could be heard shouting the N-word while Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were onstage presenting an award. The incident reached a wider audience when it aired during the BBC broadcast of the awards show. BAFTA has since offered a full apology for the incident and vowed to launch a “comprehensive review” of the ceremony. During a segment about humorous prayers that he offered for Teyana Taylor, 50 Cent and Minaj (who Cole said has been “going through a lot lately and hasn’t been herself”), Cole offered a prayer for anyone in the audience with Tourette’s to “read the room.” Later, presenting the first award of the evening, to Sinners ‘ Miles Caton, Regina Hall took a moment to recognize “kings” Jordan and Lindo for their “class,” comments that led to a standing ovation. Abbott Elementary star and creator Quinta Brunson, winning the second award of the evening for best actress in a comedy series, also offered a shoutout to the cast and crew of Sinners . “We see you,” she said. “We’re behind you … love you.” Special honorees recognized Saturday night include Chairman’s Award recipient Viola Davis and President’s Award recipient Colman Domingo. Additionally, Salt-n-Pepa and DJ Spinderella were inducted into the NAACP Image Awards ’ Hall of Fame. The ceremony also paid tribute to the late Rev. Jesse Jackson, with NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson honoring the late civil rights activist, whose family was in attendance at the ceremony. “He worked to open the eyes of those who could not see and give hope to those without it,” Johnson said. Samuel L. Jackson spoke about how the leader who shared his last name “inspired” him and others who have spoken out and protested. “Even though we can no longer hear his voice, when we see a wrong we can ask ourselves, ‘What would Jesse do?'” Jesse Jackson, Samuel L. Jackson said, made him realize “I am somebody,” referencing one of Jesse Jackson’s most famous quotes. After the audience joined him on “somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson led the crowd in the affirmation. “Reverend Jackson, because of you, we are somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson added. “Power to the people!” Numerous winners were already revealed in non-televised ceremonies earlier this week, including virtual ceremonies on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. In the virtual ceremonies, Michelle Obama, Will Packer and Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show were among the winners on night one . Lamar, SZA and Cardi B were among the night two winners . And Sinners, Gracie’s Corner, Ironheart, Celebrity Family Feud and Straw were among the multiple award winners on night three .

A “brilliantly bizarre, cult-ready vision of human psychology tested to its limits,” said Variety , ““Sirāt” is nominated for two Oscars and already won a Cannes Festival Jury Prize. “Sirāt” won most awards at Saturday’s Goya Awards ceremony. However, Alauda Ruiz de Azúa’s “Sundays,” a study of failing family dynamics, plagued by intolerance, won the biggest: best picture, director, actress (Patricia López Arnaíz) and original screenplay. “ Sundays ” won San Sebastian’s top Golden Shell last September.

Popular on Variety The biggest breakout of the night, however, was “ Deaf ,” a Berlinale Panorama Audience Award winner and portrait of the challenges facing the deaf, here a mother, in a world where they are expected to hear. Barcelona is not Berlin. It took just 150 seconds of Saturday’s Goya Awards for co-host Luis Tosar, wearing a Palestine pin, to condemn “Gaza genocide” – with the audience pretty well unanimously bursting out in applause. Susan Sarandon, winner of this year’s International Goya of Honor, thanked Spanish President Pedro Sánchez and many artists from Spain who “talk with such moral lucidity.” “It helps me to feel less alone, part of a larger community,” in a world dominated by “cruelty” and “violence,” she added. “Dictators can govern countries by whims. That can be denying gender violence and climate change, invading countries and deporting immigrants,” said Joaquin Oristrell, a co-winner of adapted screenplay for “La Cena,” again to raucous applause, In her acceptance speech, Sarandon quoted American writer Howard Zinn: “To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.” 40th Spanish Academy Goya Awards, 2026 Best Picture “Sundays,” Manu Calvo, Marisa Fernández Armenteros, Sandra Hermida, Nahikari Ipiña, Director Alauda Ruiz de Azúa, “Sundays” Actress Patricia López Arnaíz Actor Jose Ramón Soroiz, “Maspalomas” New Director Eva Libertad, “Deaf” Original Screenplay Alauda Ruiz de Azúa, “Sundays” Adapted Screenplay Joaquín Oristrell, Manuel Gómez Pereira, Yolanda García, “La Cena” Art Direction Laia Ateca, “Sirāt” New Director Eva Libertad, “Deaf” Supporting Actor Álvaro Cervantes, “Deaf” Supporting Actress Nagore Aramburu, “Sundays” New Actress Miriam Garlo, “Deaf” New Actor Toni Fernández Gabarre, “Sleepless City” Documentary Feature Albert Serra, “Afternoons of Solitude” Animated Feature “ Decorado ,” Alberto Vazquez, Chelo Loureiro, Iván Mimabres, José María Fernández de Vega Sound Amanda Villavieja, Laia Casanovas, Yasmina Praderas, “Sirāt” Original Music Kangding Ray, “Sirāt” Cinematography Mauro Herce, “Sirāt” Editing Cristóbal Fernández, “Sirāt” Production Design Oriol Maymó, “Sirāt” Original Song Alba Flores, Sílvia Pérez Cruz, “Flowers for Antonio” Special Effects Paula Gallifa Rubia, Ana Rubio, “Los Tigres,” Costume Design Helena Sanchís, “La cena,” Makeup & Hairstyling Ana López-Puigcerver, Belén López-Puigcerver y Nacho Díaz, “The Captive” Ibero-American Film “Belén,” Dolores Fonzi, Argentina European Film Fiction Short “Angulo Muerto,” Cristian Beteta Animated Short “Gilbert,” Jordi Jiménez, Arturo Lacal, Alex Salu Documentary Shor “El Santo,” Carlo D’Ursi.

According to Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office records, LaBeouf was taken into custody Saturday and charged with one additional misdemeanor count of simple battery. The Transformers star’s attorney, Sarah Chervinsky, said that after learning New Orleans police had issued a new arrest warrant Friday, LaBeouf voluntarily turned himself in to the Orleans Parish jail, according to the Associated Press . “No regular person would be required to post over $100,000 in bonds and be jailed two separate times for one misdemeanor incident,” Chervinsky said. “Just as he does not deserve preferential treatment, Mr. LaBeouf also does not deserve to be treated more harshly by the police and courts just because he is a public figure.” Related Stories General News Who Won and Lost the Week: The Great Netflix Pull-Out Edition (Plus Tyra, Shia and More) News Shia LaBeouf to Remain Free on $100,000 Bail After New Orleans Bar Altercation The legal trouble began during Mardi Gras earlier this month. LaBeouf was arrested Feb. 17 following an altercation at R Bar in the Faubourg Marigny. Authorities said he became aggressive and allegedly fought with two men, both of whom told police he assaulted them. LaBeouf is accused of punching one bartender multiple times and striking another in the face. He also allegedly shouted homophobic slurs during the incident. The Hollywood Reporter reported details of the altercation at the time. LaBeouf was later taken to a local hospital for undisclosed injuries. After being released, he was formally charged with two counts of simple battery. In an interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan released Saturday morning, the 39-year-old actor addressed what he said led to his initial arrest and discussed his recent behavior. “It’s not nice to hurt people ever. It’s fucking lame. People got hurt. I got to deal with that. I’mma deal with that in full. I’ll eat it all,” he said. “It was on me. It’s not on them. It’s on me. I messed up.” When asked if he takes responsibility, LaBeouf responded, “Definitely. Yeah. 1,000 percent.” He added, “My side is this — my behavior, bullshit. I got to deal with that. Does that mean I got to go to rehab again? I’m just not into it, bro. I don’t think my answers are there. If I genuinely did, I’d go. I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I think I have a different problem, and I’m going to address it.” The Fury actor said he believes he has a “small man complex,” explaining, “I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more so than my drinking. That’s where I’m at now on my journey, and I’m trying to navigate it.” When asked what triggered his anger, LaBeouf said, “I’ll be honest with you, big gay people are scary to me. I’m standing by myself, and three gay dudes are next to me, touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry if that’s homophobic. Then I’m that.” Asked whether that situation happens often, he said it occurred only once. “That’s why I got arrested,” he said. LaBeouf concluded, “I am wrong for touching anyone, ever. And that’s the end of my statement on this whole shit.” THR",0,2026-03-01 02:59:41

In a sprawling discussion with The New York Times , she explained, “I waited until I was absolutely sure that asking him to do this part in the movie — it’s a pretty small part, it’s just a cameo, really — I made sure, I really did some work in thinking to make sure it was the right thing to do to ask him.” The Lost Daughter filmmaker described “tearing up” while broaching the subject with her sibling, adding with a laugh that she “waited too long … that was a rookie mistake.” Related Stories News Cover Story: 'Hamnet's Jessie Buckley On Love, Her Process, Her Past And Her Connection With Co-Star Paul Mescal: ""He Held Me"" Acquisitions Netflix Snaps Up Action Thriller Spec 'Kill Switch' From Harrison Query; Jake Gyllenhaal To Star “It meant so much to me,” she added, given that she strived early on in her career to distinguish herself from her filmmaker father, screenwriter mother and fellow performer brother. She said she and the Brokeback Mountain star have “never been estranged but we’ve never been as close as we are now.” Watch on Deadline Elsewhere in the interview, Maggie Gyllenhaal described her fascination with envy and having felt some latent feelings of jealousy toward her brother’s early movie stardom. “In general, I am very interested in envy. I think there’s a reason why it’s a seven deadly sin. I’m interested in it in terms of watching other people’s movies come out. Admiration versus envy. What creates it? I think it’s usually feeling starving, like you don’t have enough,” she said, while also noting that taking a beat to reach out to Wuthering Heights director Emerald Fennell “free[d] the competition up and you realize: ‘No, no. We’re actually 100 percent on the same team. There absolutely is enough to go around.'” She concluded, “I don’t think I knew that at first, when I was young and Jake was a movie star right away. I don’t think I was in touch with the envy, but it was there.” The Bride! — due in theaters March 6 — stars Jessie Buckley (in the title role), Christian Bale, Peter Sarsgaard (also Maggie Gyllenhaal’s spouse), Annette Bening and Penélope Cruz. It loosely draws inspiration from the 1935 classic Bride of Frankenstein , itself based on Mary Shelley’s landmark novel.

I think I cried, laughed and had some amazing conversations at dinner. Related Stories KLOS-FM Radio Host Uncle Joe Benson Dies at 76 “I think especially right now, there’s so much bad news that there aren’t conversations around people who are doing great, amazing things and uplifting those people and highlighting those people,” Delevingne continues. “I think it is something…we need so badly.” Popular on Variety Since its launch in 2005, Women of Worth has grown into a nationwide movement, recognizing 200 women by providing them with mentorship and grants, community and national visibility for their grassroots efforts. Delevingne has teamed up with L’Oreal — she’s a L’Oréal Paris ambassador — ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8 to talk about the importance of uplifting women’s voices and causes. The model and actress is currently focusing on issues related to mental health and marginalized communities. “We’re laughing and joking around a lot right now by saying, ‘Everything’s on fire,’” she said. “It’s become this dark humor around the fact that no one’s feeling great…Mental health is so important right now, being able to do good for yourself so you can do good by other people.” When she’s having a “shitty day,” Delevingne will scroll GoFundMe pages: “I like seeing an actual dent that you can make to help someone.” Conversations around mental health must include discussions about social media, Delevingne says. “That algorithm is not meant for good things,” she says. “I haven’t gotten to the point where I’ve deleted Instagram off my phone yet, but I’m constantly working on self-control because I find myself going on there without even realizing I am…It’s terrifying.” She works hard on course correcitng her algorithm. “I do follow a lot of accounts about doing good things and good news,” Delevingne says. “There’s this one account for good news about women. That always makes me happy because I feel like when the pendulum is swinging so far the other way — women’s rights are getting taken away, people of color or the queer community — we have to try and push it the other way. If I’m constantly in fear, then I just don’t leave the house, which then nothing is ever going to get done.” Nominations are currently open for L’Oréal Paris’ Women of Worth program for 2026 until March 8.

Discovery Deal 1 day ago See All Penguin Random House Hello Crawlers: The “ Dungeon Crawler Carl ” TV series announced in August 2024 is alive and well at NBCUniversal and Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions, according to author Matt Dinniman , who has already read the first few scripts for the project. “Right now, we’re at the point where Chris Yost, who’s writing the show, has written a few episodes,” Dinniman told Variety in an interview Friday. “And I don’t think it’s public yet, the streaming service that has picked it up, but we’re getting pretty close to the point where a decision needs to be made, like contracts needs to be made, whether or not they’re going to go ahead and go with. And that whole process involves the scripts, involves CGI testing, and budgetary stuff, and lots of stuff that’s above my pay grade.” Related Stories KLOS-FM Radio Host Uncle Joe Benson Dies at 76 Dinniman continued: “So the project, as of this moment, is still very much alive. We’re still very much moving forward. Things are happening literally daily. But I’ve also had friends who’ve gone through this process and everything hits a brick wall. And I’ve seen it happen so many times, I’m just kind of in a, ‘Well, I’ll believe it when I see it’ state. But this is where we’re headed right now, and I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll get there.” Popular on Variety Back in 2023, Dinniman says someone reached out to him asking if the movie and TV rights were available. He spoke with an entertainment attorney who had read “Carl” and was already a fan, and the lawyer advised him that this was a legitimate offer — “but it’s not the one we went with,” Dinniman said. “He said, you need an agent. And through him, I found both my literary agent, and then my film and TV rights agents at WME. And they created a pitch and they approached multiple studios, and we had multiple people looking at it.” Dinniman says his “specific criteria” for the project was he’d “only work with someone who’s read it and enjoyed it and doesn’t want to just snatch up.” And he found that in NBCUniversal subsequently Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door, which has an overall deal with the studio. Since the series was announced, “Carl” fans have been debating whether the live-action format is the right move here. Dinniman understands the concern, but he makes the case for why he’s willing to give it a shot over animation (though MacFarlane is certainly no stranger to an animated show). “It’s kind of funny. A lot of the more hardcore nerdy fans — I mean, like I am — will say, we want it animated. And then I think actually the majority of people who aren’t into animation are going to say, we want a live action,” Dinniman said. “If you actually poll people out on the street, it’s going to be a pretty high number of live action. But that’s really high risk, high reward, because we’re not going to do it if it’s gonna look like absolute shit. And they will do CGI testing on Princess Donut and stuff like that. And that’s all I can say, I think. It’s all gonna hinge on what it looks like. But Fuzzy Door, specifically, if you watch ‘Ted’ or ‘The Orville, ‘you’ll see that they know what they’re doing when it comes to this. So I would say, don’t knock it till you try it.” Dinniman believes the potential show, which still needs to be ordered to series at a streamer or platform, is in good hands, but also says he has not revealed the planned ending of the final “Carl” book to that producing team — or to anyone else. So if, God forbid, something happens to him before he finishes the series… “Nope. That is your problem,” Dinniman said, adding: “Maybe you could get Brandon Sanderson to write it?” Dinniman says his latest release, “ Operation Bounce House ,” is an idea that’s been with him since high school, well before he conceived “Carl” around 2007. He then wrote the “vast majority” of “Bounce House” at the end of 2024 with current events being “what pretty much shaped the story it became.” Read more from Variety ‘s interview with Dinniman below, including spoilers breaking down the ending of his newly released book, “Operation Bounce House,” and teases for the upcoming eighth book in the “Dungeon Crawler Carl” series, “Parade of Horribles,” set to release May 12. “Dungeon Crawler Carl” has been dealing with the topic of genocide from the very beginning. But “Operation Bounce House” also delves into genocide. Was that because there was a specific story that you wanted to tell in “Carl” that you couldn’t there, or a different message you feel like you’re sending with “Operation Bounce House”? I think “Operation Bounce House” gets closer to today than “Carl.” “Carl” is kind of esoteric in how we deal with like othering and people who don’t view people as the same as them. But it’s also aliens versus humans, whereas this is humans versus humans. In “Operation Bounce House,” it’s very specifically related to our online behavior; how we have this computer between us, and that’s all we know about the other people. When we have this great filter that’s the government saying, “This is who they are. This is what they’ve done. This is what they’re doing to you. So this is what we should do to them.” And yes, they are similar stories, but “Operation Bounce House” is definitely a little more honest and relevant to things that are happening in the world today. How did you reach the point in “Operation Bounce House” where they give up on showing the people of Earth the horrible things that are happening on New Sonora, and instead perform their show and stream the documentary about their everyday lives? Were there any specific moments in 2024 that inspired that, and what it actually takes for people to care about what’s happening to others? When I started writing and I was like, what can they do? Do we do just another regular, big fight and then they beat them at the end? No, what happens is, they decide that instead of showing them all the horrible things they’ve done — because what happens is people see something horrible, and then they look away. But when they see something that they can relate with like, humans just being humans, then they finally relate. And it ends up it’s the pig’s and the chickens’ Instagram account that pretty much helps them along the way. And there wasn’t one specific event that happened. It’s been one thing after another; it’s happening everywhere you look. And I didn’t want it to be laser focused on one specific event anyway. But everywhere you look, it’s people who are clustered in their — I don’t want to say the word tribes, but that’s what I say in the book. It seems like this Group A doesn’t like Group B, and because of that, even though A is way stronger than Group B, they’re beating them down. And there’s echo chambers that are just reinforcing that and reinforcing that. But I’ve found strongly that when you meet someone face to face, you hang out with them, and you become friends with them, your world view changes greatly. And I don’t want to make any definitive conclusions based on that, but I’ve found people who live in settings where they have more friendly interaction with people who are different than themselves, they tend to be significantly more open minded about other people. The problem is, when you start grouping so many people together and it’s like an urban setting, then some people start to feel isolated again. So I don’t know what the solution is. I think Roger and his fellow AIs in the book had their solution, and I don’t think that’s the solution myself. Speaking of Roger Roger and the AI in “Operation Bounce House,” it’s very different than the AI we’ve gotten to know over a long time and several books in “Dungeon Crawler Carl.” What are the different things you are trying to say about AI in these stories? So first off, the AI in “Carl” is a different sort of thing. It’s not the same sort of AI that’s affecting our lives today. That’s going to be abundantly clear in Book 8, it’s a completely different thing. But that was one of the reasons why I wanted to write “Operation Bounce House,” because “Carl” started people asking me constantly, well, what’s your opinion on AI? And I think it’s pretty abundantly clear with my book “Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon,” which I wrote in 2018, that was about an artist who lost his job because of AI art. And that was before that really started to happen. And then Roger Roger, the generative AI has become more intelligent. And then they started working autonomously. And in the story of New Sonora, we make it so digital masking or filters or pretending to be someone else becomes illegal. And that’s impossible, obviously, with the way the internet currently works. So they have to tear the whole internet down and rebuild it, basically, to stop that from happening. And I don’t see us tearing down the internet to fix it, but I see this becoming a very, very huge issue. Forget the environmental stuff, which is important as well; forget the fact that AI is trained using illicitly gained materials; forget that for a moment and just focus on what’s actually going to happen. Today, a lot of people talk about how AI art sucks, it looks stupid, it’s fake. But that’s not going to keep happening. And that’s not true, first off. AI art is good and that’s gonna be a problem because it’s getting better. Mark Lawrence, who is an author, he has a blog that he wrote in August of 2025 , not very long ago. And you can look at it right now, there’s eight short stories up there. Four of them are written by famous authors, four of them are written by AI, and they’re all mixed up. You don’t know who’s who, and you’re supposed to vote and guess. And if you look at the results, they’re absolutely terrifying. These are really short stories, like 100-word stories, but that’s where AI is going. So the question has to change to, assuming AI is just as good or better than humans at some things, then should we still be afraid of it? And I think the answer is yes. First off, the whole purpose of art is to celebrate another human’s vision. The whole purpose of looking at a painting is to see through someone else’s eyes for a moment. And when you remove the human element, what’s the point? I mean, corporations aren’t gonna give a shit because they want a picture of a chair on their website, and they don’t want to pay someone $50 to draw a picture of a chair, so they’re just gonna go to AI. So this argument is never gonna solve anything, but that’s my argument. We are slowly, slowly, slowly squeezing the humanity out of the one thing that humanity shines best at, and that is our creative, our artwork. And because of that, we are slowly, slowly, slowly going to where the dark vision I envision in “Operation Bounce House,” where we are cruel to each other. And that’s the event horizon I see we’re about to step into with AI. What can we do about it? I have no fucking clue. But that’s where we’re headed, I think. You mentioned Book 8, “Parade of Horribles.” It looks like the length of this one is going to be about 700 pages. That would be the shortest book since Book 5, “Butcher’s Masquerade.” So “Butcher’s Masquerade,” I think, is 220,000 words. And this one is right on 200,000 words. It’s longer than “Gate of the Feral Gods,” or it’s about the same length, and it’s way shorter than “This Inevitable Ruin,” and shorter than “Eye of the Bedlam Bride.” What should we make of that? Well, first, it’s a non-Scolapendra floor. So there’s less — I don’t want to say less story tickering, because something very major happens at the end of it. But it was always going to be a little bit shorter, I think. In addition, Penguin Random House deliberately told me, we want this to be shorter. And I was like, that’s going to be fine — but the next one is going to be really long. So what we’re going to do, I think, is — this isn’t set in stone — but I think 9 is the last book, but it’ll be split into two books. So there’s still going to be 10 books total, but I anticipate the last one is going to be pretty wordy. I’m a pretty wordy dude. The first draft [of “Parade of Horribles”] was 235,000 words, which puts it slightly longer than “Butcher’s Masquerade,” but the final version I turned in was like 195,000 and it grew to be about 200,000. That’s still really long! The average book is 70,000 words. I’d love to know how your writing process has changed since the very beginning. The way you are writing “Carl” now vs. the way you were writing and distributing “Carl” before, knowing that in May, the number of eyes that will be on “Parade of Horribles” is so much higher. Well, it’s pretty insane. By the time I was done with Book 3, “The Dungeon Anarchist’s Cookbook,” I had maybe 500 people, 1,000 people reading it. And now, I will literally have over a million people read “Dungeon Crawler Carl” Book 8. And that’s a lot of pressure. You see other authors who may not finish their books, without naming names, and I get it. I do get it. Because what happens is, you go to these events and these signings, and people come up to you and they say, “This book has changed my life. This book, I can’t stop thinking about it, it’s everything to me.” I have people tell me that they’ve been suicidal, and they’re putting off killing themselves because they’re waiting for my book. And that’s a lot of pressure — that’s weight on my own mental health. And I can understand other authors just crushing under that weight. And for me personally, I can’t wait to sit down and write. I can’t wait to get these words out. So it affects me greatly, but it doesn’t affect my output, if that makes sense. But I worry so much about what other people think, to a certain extent, but it doesn’t stop me from doing stupid shit when I’m writing. Like, the stupidest thing you’d ever think of ends up happening at the end of Book 8, I can’t wait for people to read it. But the process is so different. I was doing everything myself, from the editing, or hiring editors and doing a lot of it just myself. And now with Book 8, I still self-publish “Dungeon Crawler Carl” and Penguin Random House licenses the right to publish the physical copies. But it is going through their editorial process now. So I have someone that I don’t know, I haven’t talked to face to face, being the one that’s sending me edits on commas and all that stuff. And that’s very different. There’s the marketing people that are setting up things like this, sending me on tour. And a lot of these people are people I’ve not necessarily met. There’s this whole engine. I was just at the Penguin Random House building, and it’s like this huge building with hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of people working there, and all of that to create all the books that they publish. Whereas in self publishing you’re so close to it, and you’re sitting there and you see the stats/ I know up to the minute how many books are being sold. And in this, you don’t get those sort of stats. So it’s so different, in so many different ways. The audience is different. In August of 2024, when the hardcover Book 1 came out, suddenly people were walking into stores and buying it and then posting about it on TikTok. My demographics went from maybe 90% male to now 40% male readers. So many more women readers are reading it and then they’re convincing their husbands and boyfriends, who don’t read, to read it. And that’s just caused an explosion in sales. We went from maybe 500,000 total sales to about 7 million at this point. And it’s just crazy. And that happened so fast that I had this rise. In literally the past 12 months, it’s just gone crazy, bonkers. This interview has been edited and condensed.

We advocate for targeted actions against government officials and oppressive agents while avoiding harm to innocent civilians. It is essential to put an end to this archaic cycle of patriarchal violence.” The body also raised its concern “for the lives of all prisoners, especially those involved in the ongoing Revolution”. “We are alarmed by the regime’s deceitful tactics, which may lead to a repeat of the Cinema Rex tragedy, where blame for civilian deaths is shifted onto foreign actors,” it said. The infamous Cinema Rex arson attack in the city of Abadan in southwest Iran in August 1978, in which Islamic extremists barred the doors of the theater and set it alight, killing up to 470 people, is seen as a trigger for the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in which the Islamic Regime come to power. It has since been proved it was the work of a quartet of Islamic revolutionaries, but claims at the time that it was a false flag operation orchestrated by the SAVAK secret police agents of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, turned public opinion and helped fuel the revolution. IIFMA’s statement was released towards the end of a fast-moving day in which the U.S. and Israel launched hundreds of missiles on strategic sites across Iran , following a pre-recorded video message from Trump that the operation was aimed at stopping the country’s nuclear campaign and bringing about regime change. Later in the day, Trump confirmed reports out of Israel that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been killed after his Tehran compound was pounded by at least 30 strikes, although Iranian officials have denied his death. The surprise military operation has provoked a mixed response with anger in some quarters at home in the U.S. over the fact Trump launched the operation without consulting Congress, and concern worldwide that the situation could escalate out of control and wreak death and destruction across the Middle East. “In these challenging times, it is only through united resistance against theocracy that we can hope to end violence and forge a path toward lasting peace and freedom. True peace is not merely the absence of conflict; it is built upon the foundation of genuine liberty and dignity for all,” said IIFMA.

The singer-songwriter, who was nominated for international artist and international song, was at the end of his smash single “Undressed” when a man joined him on the podium and shoved him hard. Security guards aggressively removed the man from the stage, and Sombr returned to the microphone to segue into his next song.

Fans were already split online over whether the incident was staged or real. Naysayers noticed that the offender was wearing a shirt that read “Sombr is a homewrecker” — a nod to his latest single “Homewrecker,” which some claimed was a dead giveaway. But others weren’t necessarily convinced it was a stunt, considering how hard he was pushed and how additional security guards came to his rescue. Popular on Variety Brits host Jack Whitehall remarked on the incident after Sombr’s performance concluded. “Such a shame we didn’t have the security ready,” he said. The incident took place just days after Britain’s BAFTA Awards last Sunday, when John Davidson, the Scottish Tourette’s syndrome activist and real-life inspiration for the film “I Swear,” disrupted that ceremony with an outburst of racial slurs that occurred as “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were onstage. “I can’t begin to explain how upset and distraught I have been as the impact from Sunday sinks in,” Davidson told Variety earlier this week. Whitehall made a joking reference to that incident — which was not bleeped from the initial BAFTA broadcast and was audible to viewers — at the top of the Brits, saying “We’ve got the best in the business on the bleep button.” Sombr is coming off a red-hot year that saw his various singles “Undressed,” “Back to Friends” and “12 to 12” impact the charts. He recently performed at the Grammy Awards, where he was nominated for best new artist alongside Addison Rae, Alex Warren, the Marías, Leon Thomas, Lola Young, Katseye and Olivia Dean, who ended up taking home the award.

Getty Images Updated at 1:05 p.m. PT : Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in an Israeli strike as part of its attack on Iran on Saturday, Israeli officials said, per multiple news outlets. Donald Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker, “We feel that is a correct story.” She had a conversation with the president on Saturday afternoon. But Iranian officials have disputed that claim, and a foreign ministry spokesman told ABC News that he was “safe and sound.” Trump told Welker that “a large number of their leaders have also been killed.” Overnight, Trump announced in a video statement that “major combat operations” were underway. Watch on Deadline The military action, dubbed Operation Epic Fury, began with blasts being heard in Iran’s capital city of Tehran around 9.30 am local time on Saturday morning, with reports of people running in the streets in panic. There were also strikes on military sites in Kermanshah, Qum, Isfahan, Tabriz, Karaj and Kenarak. Iran state news agency reported 57 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a girls school in Southern Iran, and another 60 wounded.

There were also reports of blasts in Saudi Arabia’s capital of Riyadh, Jordan and Iraq. News broke around 7pm local time in Dubai (7am PT) that the Fairmont Hotel in the Emirati city’s Palm Jumeirah district, a neighbourhood popular with expats and tourists, had been hit by falling debris from an intercepted missile and was on fire. The Dubai Media Office issued a statement around 7.50 pm local time confirming an incident in the Palm Jumeirah area, saying the resulting fire was under control with four individuals having sustained injuries. In a separate earlier incident, Emirati-state news agency reported one person had been killed in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, after debris fell on a residential area. Aside from military installations, U.S. and Iran targets included Iran’s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, with seven missiles hitting the area near his presidential palace and compound. Khamenei has been Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, succeeding the Islamic Republic’s late founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A clutch of Israeli media outlets claimed that Khamenei had been killed but Iranian authorities countered these reports saying he was alive and would be addressing the nation. His whereabouts is unknown. Trump announced the operations in an eight-minute video statement, released in the early hours of the U.S. East Coast morning, in which he said the aim was “to crush’ Iran’s military and “eliminate its nuclear program” as well as bring about a change in government. “Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,” he said. “Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas and our allies throughout the world.” (read full speech below). pic.twitter.com/BZuJDudLej — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2026 The U.S. president also called on the Iranian people, who have been subjected to a harsh crackdown against pro-democracy protests in recent weeks, to seize the moment once the bombs have stopped falling to bring about regime change. “To the great, proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere,” he said. “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond.” TV Networks Scramble TV and radio networks worldwide scrambled to get on board the story , breaking into normal programming as a chaotic picture of the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran and Iranian retaliation across the Gulf started to take shape. In a note, NBC News said it put out breaking news on NBC News NOW at 1:44 am ET, followed by a network report at 1:50 am ET, with Jessica Layton anchoring. It has been providing rolling coverage ever since on network and NOW with Peter Alexander taking over anchoring after Trump’s speech around 5 am ET, and joined by Saturday TODAY co-anchor Laura Jarrett at 6 am ET. Coverage over the morning included an exclusive live interview with the Iranian Foreign Minister. Laura Jarrett, Peter Alexander and Kristen Welker on NBC News Special report NBC News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also issued a statement on Saturday, saying that the aim was to remove the Islamic Republic regime from power. The operation “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,” he said. “The time has come for all sections of the people in Iran… to remove the yoke of tyranny… and bring a free and peace-loving Iran,” he added. The military operations follow in the wake of a massive building up since mid-January of the largest force of U.S. warships and aircraft in the Middle East in decades, as Trump tried to force Iran’s Islamic Regime government to abandon its nuclear program in talks. News of the joint U.S. and Israeli attack has met with concerned reaction at home in the U.S. and from leaders worldwide, amid fears that the conflict will escalate and uncertainty over the longer term future for Iran, whether its hardline Islamic Republic falls or not. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned the fact Trump had triggered military action without consulting the U.S. Congress. “The Constitution is clear: the decision to take this nation to war rests with Congress, and launching large-scale military operations – particularly in the absence of an imminent threat to the United States – raises serious legal and constitutional concerns,” he said in a statement on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting, writing on X: “The ongoing escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s Full Speech On “Major Combat Operations” A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world. For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States, our troops, and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel. In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as US naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lanes. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer. From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained, and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts, and it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous October 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before. Iran is the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I’ll say it again. They can never have a nuclear weapon. That is why, in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime’s nuclear program at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. Again, they wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. They didn’t know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades. They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message. For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs — or roadside bombs, as they are sometimes called — to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon. This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration, and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength, or sophistication. My administration has taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region. Even so — and I do not make this statement lightly — the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this — not for now — we’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way, and we trust that with His help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail. To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces, and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity — or, in the alternative, face certain death. So lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great, proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force.

Michael Buckner/PMC/Kristina Bumphrey/PMC/Jesse Grant/PMC/Gilbert Flores/PMC/Jesse Grant/PMC Every producer has a story to tell when it comes to revealing the challenges they faced when making an awards-worthy movie, but it was Weapons ‘ Miri Yoon who hit the nail on the head during a celebration Saturday for this year’s PGA Awards nominees for Theatrical Motion Picture. “Everything’s hard. Producing is hard. It is ghetto. It is difficult. There are problems to fix every damn day. It never ends,” Yoon said during a panel at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills. “Even with us, it was like with a lot of people on this panel. We had a cast, we had a budget, we had a schedule. We’re ready to go. The strike hit. We had to rebuild the entire cast. We were shooting in beautiful, wonderful Atlanta, with an incredible crew, but in the dead ass of summer, while we were trying to be the fall in the Pacific Northwest. And then we had kids, 17 of them, and their parents.” Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List For Children's, Sports, Shortform & Innovation Categories News PGA Awards Postpones Tonight's Children's & Sports NYC Ceremony Amid Blizzard “So yeah, it was freakin’ brutal, guys, but it’s amazing,” continued Yoon, who was joined on stage by Bugonia ‘s Lars Knudsen, F1 ‘s Jerry Bruckheimer, Frankenstein ‘s Guillermo del Toro, Hamnet ‘s Pippa Harris, Marty Supreme ‘s Eli Bush, One Battle After Another ‘s Sara Murphy, Sentimental Value ‘s Andrea Berentsen Ottmar, Sinners ‘ Sev Ohanian and Train Dreams ‘ Teddy Schwarzman. All are up for the Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures at tonight’s PGA Awards. Watch on Deadline “At the end of the day, the way I see our jobs as producers is that we’re in the service industry,” Yoon told moderator Jess Cagle. “We’re in service of a crew that’s busting their asses for us. We’re in service of actors who are putting their craft front and center. We’re in service to whomever is financing the movie. And we’re in service of the filmmaker and the vision they’re bringing to the table.” The other nominees got a chance to share the types of challenges they faced while making their memorable movies. For Bugonia ‘s Knudsen, it was time; it took eight years to remake the 2003 South Korean film Save the Green Planet! by Jang Joon-hwan. For Bruckheimer, it was getting the F1 screenplay right, considering how many drivers, races and promoters were involved in the worldwide production. For Bush, it was teaching a sea lion how to play ping pong. For Murphy, it was having to deal with the passing of producer Adam Somner and the temporary absence of Benicio Del Toro, who had to go off to shoot The Phoenician Scheme for Wes Anderson. For Harris, it was rebuilding the Old Globe Theatre. And for Ohanian, it was dealing with the unexpected appearance of gators on location and making the horror movie’s surreal montage. “I hope we got an A,” he said. The producers were then asked to explain how they got their start in the biz. Nothing could beat Del Toro’s childhood memories of shooting a Super 8 film about a killer potato who ultimately gets run over by a car, but stories from Ohanian, Ottmar and Schwarzman came close. The Sinners producer recalled how his 2007 YouTube video about an Armenian dad who chews out his son for crashing the car went viral; Ottmar explained how she pivoted from studying engineering at the University of Washington to working as a personal assistant for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in the aughts; and Schwarzman, a former lawyer, regaled the audience about how he concocted a 20-year plan that went from attending law school to somehow managing to solve a big Hollywood problem while riding up an imaginary elevator with Tinseltown muckety-mucks. “I knew that they were going to have a problem that they were talking about in the elevator, and I would give them my idea, and then they would realize that there’s, like, creative merit, and I could get into the creative side of filmmaking,” Schwarzman said. “So that was my plan. That’s why I was a lawyer, which again, tells you that I am a terrible student and a terrible employee and probably a terrible strategist.” “But a good storyteller,” remarked del Toro. The Producers Guild will honor a trio of industry heavyweights with career honors this weekend. Blumhouse’s Jason Blum will receive the Milestone Award, Spider-Verse franchise producer Amy Pascal is set for the David O. Zelznick Achievement Award, and Mara Brock Akil will be presented with the Norman Lear Achievement Award.

The tune, which Warren wrote for and is featured in Bess Kargman ’s documentary Diane Warren: Relentless , extends the songwriter’s undesirable records for most noms in that Oscar category without a win and most noms for a woman in any Oscar category without a win. (Warren did receive an honorary statuette from the Academy in 2022, but it’s just not the same thing!) It’s also her ninth consecutive nom in the category, and eleventh nom in 12 years. Related Stories News Ghislaine Maxwell or Diane Warren? The Internet Can't Decide Hollywoof! Diane Warren: Cat Crusader Given that Warren is a perennial bridesmaid, one might assume that the 69-year-old Van Nuys native is disliked by her peers, but the exact opposite, in fact, is true. She’s actually one of the most popular people in town, especially amongst her peers in the Academy’s music branch, who solely determine the best original song Oscar nominees. And you don’t rack up 17 noms because people don’t like you or your work. Rather, the issue seems to be that in years when Warren has been nominated for an absolute banger (like, say, “How Do I Live,” from Con Air ), she has had the misfortune of coming up against another one that is somehow even bigger (like, in that year, “My Heart Will Go On,” from Titanic ). And when she has been nominated on other occasions (like, say, the year that she and Lady Gaga were co-nominated for “Til It Happens to You,” from the documentary The Hunting Ground ), she has had the misfortune of coming up against songs from films that were much more widely seen by the full Academy (in that case, “Glory,” from Selma ), which determines the best original song winner. One never knows when the Oscar gods might smile upon Warren, so she assures THR that, as always, she will be at this year’s ceremony — where “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters is expected to win best original song — with hope in her heart and a speech in her pocket. In the meantime, this musical walk down memory lane — which Warren recorded at RealSongs, her music publishing company’s headquarters in Hollywood — offers a powerful reminder of just how great — and unlucky — she has been for so long!
