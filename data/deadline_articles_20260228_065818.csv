The 15-20-minute affair was moderated by Netflix Chief Communications Officer Dani Dudeck and did not include a Q&A section, sources said. In their remarks, Sarandos and Peters sounded confident about their decision t o walk away from Warner Bros. and explained their reasons. According to sources, they said that they had a number for the storied film and TV studio and knew what it had to be in order to make sense for the company. When the Warner Bros. Discovery board came back with the recommendation for the higher price offered by Paramount and asked Netflix to match it, the duo’s response was a quick no. Sarandos and Peters noted that they had done due diligence and didn’t feel like they needed to prolong the process if the number was above the threshold they had set.

Sarandos and Peters went on to thank employees, including those who had spent the last month and a half working on integration that didn’t happen, and asked people to go carry on with their work. They may have showed restrain and discipline in walking away, but that does not mean that Sarandos and Peters were not disappointed by the outcome of the Warner Bros. sale. Sarandos, in particular, had made it clear how much he wanted the century-old studio. With Paramount’s hostile takeover efforts ramping up in the past couple of weeks, he went on a publicity tour, talking up Netflix’s cause in several interviews, and was in Washington D.C. for meetings about the Netflix-WB deal when news of WBD board’s recommendation came in Thursday afternoon. Like the Warner Bros. Discovery town hall , which was held an hour earlier this morning, the 9 AM PT Netflix one was scheduled last minute, after WBD Board’s Paramount “superior offer” declaration Thursday afternoon and Netflix’s pullout an hour and a half later. Incidentally, it was the second Netflix town hall this week; the streamer also held their regular quarterly town hall a couple of days ago, I hear. As for Netflix staff’s reaction to losing Warner Bros., it is said to be mixed, with people divided over the news but virtually all stunned by it. “The office was quiet yesterday,” one person said.

The directing duo, consisting of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett , recently described “how hard” they wanted to go with their version of the film, before ultimately departing the project to direct their vampire ballerina flick, Abigail (2024), with Christopher Landon temporarily stepping in for the pair. “We never read a draft of any version of Scream 7 that we were going to do because we had left to do Abigail before that,” noted Bettinelli-Olpin to Entertainment Weekly . “The thing that we had in our minds for Scream 7 was sort of like, ‘How hard can we go with this?’ It was the thing that we talked a lot about. For us, it was always this idea of, [if] Scream VI is like a secret feel-good movie, Scream 7 ‘s going to f*ck you up. That was as much as we ever got to.” Related Stories News Skeet Ulrich Says He Was Supposed To Return For ‘Scream 7’ Before Melissa Barrera’s Firing News Melissa Barrera Appears To React To ‘Scream 7’ Premiere Protest: “I See You” Gillett added, “Given that we expanded the sort of scope of the story by going to New York, the other thing that we had talked about — just Matt and I, by the way, it wasn’t a conversation with the writers — was, ‘How do you do the opposite for 7 ?’ Like, shrink it down and make it this like ultra-contained, almost continuous, like minute-to-minute thing. But outside of our own stupid idea, we weren’t privy to any plan beyond just, ‘There’s gonna be another one.'” Watch on Deadline Although they didn’t have specifics to share, Skeet Ulrich recently teased what was supposed to happen in Scream 7 with his murderous character Billy Loomis’ daughter Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera) and her sister Tara (Jenna Ortega) in the “really, really interesting” sequel, before Barrera was fired from the franchise . Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett attend the premiere of ‘Abigail’ on April 17, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Gilbert Flores/Variety “I’m not involved. I’m really excited though,” he said of Scream 7 . “I’m excited for [original Scream (1996) writer] Kevin Williamson to take the helm and to see what the mastermind of it all comes up with. I have no clue.” Ulrich added, “I used to know because part of coming back for five and six was being a part of seven. It was a three-picture arc for Billy Loomis, or the imagination of Billy Loomis in Melissa Barrera’s character’s head. But when all that went down with her, obviously you lose her and you lose what’s in her head.” Spyglass fired Barrera in November 2023 over her social media posts on the Israel-Hamas conflict and the “atrocities being committed against Palestinians,” explaining the company has “zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.” Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott in ‘Scream 7’ Paramount/Spyglass Following her ousting, Jenna Ortega also exited the franchise , later noting that the sequel “ was all kind of falling apart ” without Barrera to play its new ‘final girl’ Sam Carpenter. Director Christopher Landon dropped out of the project as well, citing “highly aggressive and really scary” death threats targeting his children . Neve Campbell was then brought back to reprise her role as OG ‘final girl’ Sidney Prescott in March 2024, with original Scream (1996) writer Williamson on board to direct.

Discovery took Paramount’s “superior” offer and Netflix pulled out, Paramount+ held a previously planned premiere screening for Taylor Sheridan ‘s new drama The Madison starring Michelle Pfeiffer. Symbolically, given the events of the past 24 hours, the Friday premiere was held at a favorite event place of future corporate sibling HBO, the San Vicente Bungalows, where the WBD streamer holds its Emmy parties as well as premiere screenings, including the one for House of the Dragon. Related Stories News Where to Watch All The 'Scream' Films: Streaming Guide News 'Tulsa King' Spinoff Starring Samuel L. Jackson Gets New Title After Moving Setting From NOLA To Frisco, TX; Taylor Sheridan Writing All Episodes The Madison screening was hosted by Paramount’s Direct to Consumer chair Cindy Holland who called the family drama an “unexpected, incisive and intimate” entry in the Taylor Sheridan universe. The series debuts the first three hours of its six-episode first season on March 14. As Deadline revealed , a six-episode second season is already in the can, with its release date TBD. Sheridan wrote every episode of both installments. Watch on Deadline Production on Season 2 of The Madison was wrapping when Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount Global was completed, with Holland and her team, led by Head of Originals Jane Wiseman, taking over Paramount+. While, as Holland said, “I cannot take credit for anything related to The Madison except my desire to support this series which I’m very proud of,” the show fits into the new regime strategy to expand into female-driven dramas to balance out Paramount+’s existing slate, including hit Taylor Sheridan series such as Landman and Tulsa King as well as the Star Trek franchise. Two high-profile recent commissions, Discretion , starring Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning, and Fear Not, headlined by Anne Hathaway, also both fall into the female-forward lane which involves stories and talent in front and behind the camera. In addition to a largely female cast led by Pfeiffer, The Madison has Christina Alexandra Voros as director, executive producer and cinematographer on all six episodes from Season 1. Holland called Sheridan “a very talented artist and a joy to work with.” In addition to his slate of ongoing series, he has three upcoming ones, The Madison and Yellowstone spinoff The Dutton Ranch for Paramount+ as well as fellow Yellowstone offshoot Marshals for CBS, which will stream next day on Paramount+. The prolific writer-producer remains based at Paramount until January 2029 when he moves to NBCUniversal . The news of his new deal made waves in October , putting a spotlight on his relationship with the post-merger Paramount Skydance leadership. Sheridan has received several Paramount+ renewals since and recently committed to writing all eight episodes of Tulsa King spinoff Frisco King starring Samuel L. Jackson. Under the new regime, Paramount+ is experimenting with release patterns beyond Paramount+’s traditional weekly episode debut or the binge model introduced by Netflix where Holland and Wiseman were key programming executives for many years. For instance, The Madison ‘s first season is being released in two weekly installments of three episodes each. The series, which follows New York City’s the Clyburns to the Madison River valley of central Montana, is produced by Paramount Television Studios, David C. Glasser’s 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. In addition to Sheridan, in her brief remarks, Holland acknowledged Glasser as well as “the incredible” Pfeiffer, who attended the screening. She reminiscent about seeing Pfeiffer in Scarface and Grease 2 when she was young. “But when I saw your performance in Dangerous Liaisons i n the theater, it was that day that I knew I wanted to support that kind of art, those kind of performances,” Holland added, addressing the Oscar-nominated actress. The Madison also stars Kurt Russell, Beau Garrett, Elle Chapman, Patrick J. Adams, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Kevin Zegers, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova, Matthew Fox and Will Arnett.

Wain said, “I think we’re all hungry to have more movies in theaters that are designed to provide laughter and joy, first and foremost — and I can’t wait for audiences to experience this very first chapter in the GDU (Gail Daughtry Universe)!” “To have our film embraced by Sony Pictures Classics, a company that has championed visionary filmmakers for decades, is incredibly special. I am deeply grateful for their passion and support and excited to work together on this,” added producer Crystine Zhang. “ Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass is the most hilarious comedy we have seen in ages with one of the most incredible and surprising indie casts any film could ask for. In a time when audiences need to smile, David Wain has delivered an entertainment that will have audiences’ cheeks hurting from all their laughs,” said Sony Pictures Classics. The film is produced by Anthony Bregman, Peter Cron, Marino, Wain, Zhang and Charles Zhong. EPs include Robert Herjavec, Chechen Dong, Tom Griffin, Amanda Chang, Adrian Politowski, Jamie Canniffe, Franny Baldwin, Deutch, Hamm and Slattery. Additional notable film creatives include cinematographer Kevin Atkinson ( A Futile and Stupid Gesture ), production designer Justin Lieb ( Stranger Than Fiction ), editor John Daigle ( Plus One ), costume designer Bryn Carter ( A Tree Fell in the Woods ), and composer Craig Wedren ( School of Rock ).

Following Wednesday’s world premiere of Scream 7 , now playing in theaters, the actor told Deadline that despite reprising his role as Chad Meeks-Martin and starring in last year’s V-Day slasher Heart Eyes , the idea of being considered a ‘Scream King’ “stresses me out.” “I grew up with a certain affinity for horror and genre storytelling, and I feel like my natural proclivity to love stories, the Trojan horse sentimentality and themes through bombast and spectacle, is kind of what compels me as an audience member,” he explained. “And then as an artist, I feel like it allows certain stories that we tell as people to kind of transcend time or epoch and kind of resonate regardless of generation or experience.” Related Stories Red Carpet Premieres Kevin Williamson Comments On “Free Palestine” Protest At ‘Scream 7’ Premiere: “They Have The Right To Be Heard” Trailers ‘The Gates’ Trailer: James Van Der Beek Plays A Murderous Pastor In One Of His Final Roles Gooding added, “So, horror movies are something I love, and hopefully, I get to keep doing them for the rest of my life. But the ‘Scream King’ moniker thing always stresses me out because I feel like there’s just so much more I wanna do. And I appreciate it, but I’m trying my best to live up to it.” Watch on Deadline In the thriller genre, Gooding recently ventured to Catoosa, Oklahoma to work with James Van Der Beek on his final film, The Gates , in which about three young Black men heading to party find themselves trapped in a gated community, where they witness a resident commit murder. “It was a lot of trying your best to remain present and having someone as seasoned and giving and considerate as James to kind of lead that way and incite a lot of growth, at least in me as an artist,” explained Gooding. “It meant that even though I was tired every day, I still felt like I was being productive and educated on the nature of leading a film, and how to lead with grace and be considerate of all others as he does so effortlessly.” Read on about Mason Gooding’s return as Chad Meeks-Martin in Scream 7 , now in theaters, as well as his upcoming performances in The Gates , I Want Your Sex and 72 Hours . DEADLINE: It’s cool to see you and Mindy return, and I feel like you’ve kind of become somewhat of a ‘Scream King’ in the past few years with Heart Eyes and the Scream franchise. What’s that been like? MASON GOODING: You know, I grew up with a certain affinity for horror and genre storytelling, and I feel like my natural proclivity to love stories, the Trojan horse sentimentality and themes through bombast and spectacle, is kind of what compels me as an audience member, and then as an artist. I feel like it allows certain stories that we tell as people to kind of transcend time or epoch and kind of resonate regardless of generation or experience, so horror movies are something I love, and hopefully, I get to keep doing them for the rest of my life. But the ‘Scream King’ moniker thing always stresses me out because I feel like there’s just so much more I wanna do. And I appreciate it, but I’m trying my best to live up to it. DEADLINE: That’s fair. I’m sure you heard about the protests last night. What was it like returning to this movie without Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega? GOODING: I think, in terms of engaging with something that began as a like meaningful family-oriented—in terms of the experience—project, that you hope that remains constant moving forward, obviously, you don’t know the likelihood of sequels. And getting to engage with the artistry of Melissa’s immense talent and Jenna’s incredible penchant for creativity, I’m grateful for the amount of time I got to spend with them in 5 and 6 . So, coming back for 7 , I think it felt like a natural process to go through a level of grief. And once they had discovered their story with Neve [Campbell] and Kevin [Williamson] coming back into it, I think after you process the change that takes place in a franchise as ubiquitous as Scream , my North Star kind of just became, how do I support these people that have created this world that means so much to me? And in an attempt to pay tribute to something that has been around since my birth, as I was born, I think a few days after Scream premiered, it was really just in discussions with them about how meaningful it would be to bring Neve and Sidney back into the fold in a way that I think was just very exciting for me. Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin in ‘Scream 7’ (2026) (Jessica Miglio/Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: And I also thought it was funny to see Chad and Mindy now as Gale’s “hot interns.” GOODING: Right, as we put it. The evolution of character became such a natural element to how you play the character. I loved that Chad had a level of exhaustion that I think is natural, given his experience in the past two films. And I think that juxtaposes nicely with Jasmin [Savoy Brown] portraying Mindy as still as passionate, as exuberant as she is, meaning that she will always be dedicated to her inquiry and pursuit of correctly guessing, or incorrectly guessing the nature of the film they’re in. But also, just for them, it’s real life, the lives that they lead. DEADLINE: I feel like both of them are practically invincible at this point. GOODING: See, it’s funny cause you do start to wonder what it is that coalesces into a kill in the Scream franchise. Obviously, Dewey has had his fair share of stabs, but it wasn’t until they did the old stab and pull up method that seemed to do him in. I’ve always wanted to die in a spectacular fashion in a movie. The closest I ever got was this movie I did called Fall , where I fell, and off-camera. Scream is a great opportunity to get murdered in a much more memorable way, but it hasn’t happened yet, so I’m just trying to figure out the best way to incorporate that in, somehow. Maybe, Chad has a brother, and I can play the brother, and then the brother dies. DEADLINE: Yeah, they’re triplets. GOODING: Yeah, exactly … But see, I’m a big text analysis nerd. I love the idea that Chad predicates a lot of his character and understanding on the protection of others. He’s the type of person to put his body on the line for the people that he cares about. DEADLINE: I heard that there’s already like talks about Scream 8 . GOODING: [Kevin Williamson] did say that. It’s funny, I think the first time I had engaged with even the idea of continuing, someone had asked Kevin, and he brought it up that on set, that you just start coming up with ideas , and I feel like I don’t have the foresight to think longterm like that. They obviously haven’t had any discussions with me, but I appreciate that in putting Kevin back in the driver’s seat, in a lot of ways, we have access to his line of thinking and how all-encompassing it is, how little threads can be laid in one movie and have that pay off in a sequel or in a long-standing franchise. So, I’m not surprised, but I am personally, especially cause I wasn’t a part of those conversations, I’m curious to know what about 7 piqued his interest to return to an 8 , aside from the obvious, being Isabel May’s incredible performance, but that’s certainly no surprise for her. She’s remarkable in all ways, so. Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin and Jasmin Savoy Brown as Mindy Meeks-Martin in ‘Scream 7’ (2026) (Jessica Miglio/Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: Yeah, she was a great choice for Sidney’s daughter GOODING: I thought so too. DEADLINE: And I know you also have The Gates coming up. What can you tell me about that? GOODING: The Gates , it takes place in Texas. It’s about these three Black boys that try to make their way to a party in the wee hours of the evening and take a shortcut through a gated community, end up witnessing a murder, and then are pursued through that gated community by the perpetrator of said murder, and are blamed for it throughout. Filming it, we shot in Catoosa, Oklahoma, which I never thought I’d spend much time there, but now I know it intimately. I feel like we had so many assets that made the film feel so meaningful on the day, that to share it with people is so exciting, especially given our willingness to navigate certain thematic elements, like a relationship to federal authority or even a spiritual authority, as the antagonist of the film, played by the late great James Van Der Beek, misappropriates and also weaponizes the concept of faith and belief in religion and community to sort of direct the ire of the entire community into these three Black men that have ultimately just been trying to navigate their way out of said community. But, it was super fun, four weeks of straight night shoots. It was a lot of trying your best to remain present and having someone as seasoned and giving and considerate as James to kind of lead that way and incite a lot of growth, at least in me as an artist, meant that even though I was tired every day, I still felt like I was being productive and educated on the nature of leading a film, and how to lead with grace and be considerate of all others as he does so effortlessly. DEADLINE: Well, I’m sorry for your loss. That one cut deep, really. GOODING: I know, truly, and my heart goes out to his family. I personally go back and forth on the way we engage in honoring, posthumously, an artist’s body of work, and to me, I don’t look beyond the fact that I was able to meet him and have an experience on set. That was as impactful and meaningful to me, that I can now engage and share with my understanding of James in his personhood, outside of his work, that has meant a lot, not only to me, but to all people fortunate enough to watch his work. I can say that his personhood is as remarkable and all-encompassing in its own right, which you always hope people are as wonderful as you think they are, and James was certainly that. James Van Der Beek in ‘The Gates’ (2026) (Sherwood Jones/Lionsgate /Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: That’s great to hear. I really enjoyed I Want Your Sex . Gregg Araki is my favorite director, so it’s just cool to see him back. GOODING: He’s got good taste. It’s funny that he has a penchant for visibility, not only of community, but also of lifestyle and taste. And I feel like his fan base is also so keen on seeing something expressed, whether through sexuality or the aesthetics of sex, in a way that feels like spectacle. If in a horror movie, you have these gruesome kills and these crazy killer masks and things, Greg predicates a lot of his aesthetic on the humanity and the humor and the awkwardness based around sexuality and what that might look like from a cerebral standpoint, and also how that might feel from a set design or character standpoint. It’s very cool. DEADLINE: Yeah, his entire aesthetic, from the beginning, has always just been so inspiring to me. You play Zap, who’s a very outspoken gay character, and I know you have a lot of gay fans. Was there a pressure for you to get it right for the gay fans? GOODING: Of course, trying to pay tribute to the queer community by actually expressing knowingness and understanding, both of the adversity experienced in real life, and how that might incite Zap’s confidence in his willingness to reject social etiquette, as his version of reclaiming his own agency. I feel as though my own personal experiences kind of become more manageable by portraying characters that have a level of confidence and that ingrained sense of community that I love about my queer friends and idols, that happened to make the most meaningful art, bred through that adversity, that I feel like portraying that self-assuredness. And he’s very fashion forward. There was a piece that Zap wears in the gallery that was made, customized specifically off the runway, that I was lucky enough to put on. And I feel like Zap, as it relates to his identity, is able to push the boundaries and to be outspoken because he knows in theory what it feels like to be othered, or in the worst case, unpersoned. And I love any opportunity to play a character that is separate from me, but one that I can investigate and do research on and understand as best that I can, and hopefully, I did a good job. You have to let me know. But he was certainly the pleasure of a lifetime. DEADLINE: Yeah, he was fun to watch, definitely. And I didn’t realize the last time we talked, this was a reunion for you and Olivia Wilde, which is crazy because I love Booksmart . What was it like working with her again after so many years? GOODING: Obviously, the dissimilarity between being directed by her and being technically a co-star of her is kind of getting to engage with her brilliance on multifacets. The fact that she has such a vision and a brain for direction and narrative allows her performance to take all that creativity and understanding of world-building and turn it into a laser beam of focus into a singular person or singular character. That meant following that lead was as challenging as you would want it to be, to feel productive. But she also subverts that by being so giving and communicative about process and character, and I feel like whether she’s acting or she’s directing, there’s always an opportunity to learn something from both in the way that she carries herself and also the way she discusses intent and process. It’s the reason I’m here today, certainly, and also something I benefited from greatly as her co-star. DEADLINE: It was great seeing both of you in that movie. Any chance there’s like a 10-year reunion Booksmart movie on the horizon? GOODING: I would love to do that. Obviously, as I said, it’s hard to think longterm about what creatively makes the most sense in terms of reinvestigating narrative in a sequel or in a franchise, but Booksmart is one of those things where, because it’s a high school narrative, I’m always fascinated to know who these kids become in their adult lives. And if there was a Booksmart 2 , any opportunity to watch Kaitlyn Dever or Beanie Feldstein step back into those characters would be exciting for me, or Billie Lourd as Gigi, that for me, would be very exciting. But if people watch it, I’m sure they’d make it happen. It just depends on what people want. Keith Powers, Algee Smith and Mason Gooding in ‘The Gates’ (2026) (Sherwood Jones/Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: I would definitely go see it. I loved the first one. GOODING: You and me both. Be there opening night. I don’t even need to be in it. I would watch it 10 times. DEADLINE: And I know you have a few projects coming up. What can you tell me about 72 Hours ? GOODING: It’s a bachelor party comedy in which, I’m engaged and my best man, played by Marcello Hernandez, and my bachelor buddies, Ben Marshall, Kam [Patterson], we accidentally invite Kevin Hart, he plays the character Joe. Hijinks kind of ensues through the streets of Miami. It was definitely, funnily enough, despite that incredibly warm and goofy premise, it was maybe some of the most challenging work I’ve had to do, mostly just cause I don’t think I’m that funny. DEADLINE: No, I think you’re funny. GOODING: I appreciate you saying that cause I will take that compliment as much as I can, cause it makes me feel like hopefully I’m wrong. But in this case, getting to work opposite Kevin, who has a masterful handle over being a conduit for comedy or drama when need be, it meant that I didn’t need to be very funny, cause I could rely on Marcello, Ben or Kam to inundate the story with so many jokes, and I have my little drama corner over here. And then Kevin allowed himself to, by proxy of his talent, made himself the conduit to connect the two, so that you’re getting the funny as well as the sentimental moments that make the movie, in my mind, actually very poignant and thoughtful in a way that I’m really excited for people to see. DEADLINE: That’s awesome. You definitely have plenty of funny roles. Like I said, in I Want Your Sex , there’s just nonstop laughs with your dialogue. He’s very unhinged. I love it. GOODING: But that’s under the watchful eye of Gregg, who himself is so hilarious, just innately. It made the job super easy. DEADLINE: Your dad is also a great comedic actor. I read somewhere that you went to set with him once and then decided you’d rather go to college first instead of acting. Is that right? GOODING: I don’t know if it happened quite as succinctly as that, because then I would have maybe more direction in my adolescence. But I grew up on set and would try and parse out as much usable knowledge about the craft of acting, as well as the business, that when I went to college, I think my original intent was to study acting and be trained from a classical standpoint. And he—I hope he doesn’t mind me saying, he’s not here, and I haven’t spoken to him in a minute—but he was like, “I think you should go study something else. Being an actor means empathy for personhood and understanding of the human condition.” He’s like, “I don’t know if learning technique through a college course is going to yield that understanding.” He’s like, “I think you should experience a different curriculum that might broaden your understanding of people.” Hence, I studied psychology and writing, which ended up being super useful, because I was able to spot out and analyze the script in a way that’s helped me a ton in my professional life. And also psychology means I can be my own therapist. No! I can really understand the human condition from a more collegiate standpoint and understand why we are the way that we are. So, when I talk to a director about decisions or choices, it’s not necessarily based on a technique, but rather a textbook understanding of causality and why we are the way that we are, specifically through our adolescence experience. DEADLINE: I noticed that like in the times we’ve spoken, your answers are very well thought-out, and it really provides like interesting perspective that I appreciate. GOODING: Yeah. Obviously, I’m still formulating my understanding of our place in culture as artists, specifically as it relates to my hand in that, and I feel like what we owe outside of the work that is consumed by an audience is an understanding and thoughtful nature with the work that we put out. I try my best to have an opinion on the films that I make, and also the narratives and stories that they tell, so that when I’m discussing something that might mean a lot to people like Scream or Love, Victor , I feel like I’ve had maybe the most heartfelt interactions about that show. It’s not coming from a place—this is no offense to actors that will publicly tout, “oh, I needed the money, I took the job”—I feel like the reason I act is to engage with the innate desire for people to tell stories. … Otherwise, I don’t want an audience member who maybe responds so resoundingly to that work to feel as though it didn’t mean as much to me as it did to them, cause at that point, it’s like, you might as well AI me. Our opinions are what make us human. It’s what I think separates us as individuals, and also ironically, is what brings us together through discourse. It’s why I love when actors, performers, athletes discuss their work and they discuss their intent, because it allows the person to shine through in a way that is very meaningful to me.

Plus, Disney’s Asad Ayaz On Studio’s Oscar Hopes For 2025’s Biggest Movie – Notes On The Season View All February 27, 2026 3:56pm Getty Images A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit. Ballots are now in the hands — or laptops, actually — of the nearly 10,000 eligible voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and they have only this weekend and a few days after until March 5 to turn in their individual verdicts. That comes after a long season where the impact of the Oscar race has stretched out almost a full year if you consider that Sinners , with an all-time record 16 Oscar nominations , opened April 17, 2025, almost 11 months to the day of the 98th annual Academy Awards taking place on March 15, 2026. Then you had Cannes way back in May, when four of the five nominees for Best International Feature made their world premieres — including two Best Picture nominees in Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent , which between them represent 13 nominations overall. And then in June, Apple and Warner Bros unveiled F1 , another Best Picture nominee. Finally what is considered the “official” start of Oscar season came around with the fall-festival trifecta of Venice/Telluride/Toronto and the 6 1/2-month campaigns began in earnest. But don’t kid yourself, this has become a year-round adventure. Related Stories News Oscar Nominations 2026: ‘Sinners’ Leads With Record 16, ‘One Battle’ Next – The Complete List Below The Line 2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More So now it is all up to the voters, who have a new wrinkle in the process this year. They are supposed to swear under oath that they have seen all the movies they are voting on. Okay, that may be an exaggeration. AMPAS members don’t have to “swear under oath,” they simply have to attest to the fact that they have actually either viewed the nominees in a theater, in the Academy’s digital screening room (where technology can affirm the film was played, if not actually watched, by the voter in question), or have seen it by some other method. Essentially this is all on the honor system and was needed because it has become all too apparent that just a very few of those films eligible for Oscars in any given year are really being seen by large swaths of voters, and by extension don’t have a fighting chance of being nominated. The Television Academy has done this in various ways, also on the honor system, but in some years fortified with signed affidavits for each category. Watch on Deadline (Clockwise from top left) ‘Sinners’, ‘Hamnet’, ‘ One Battle After Another ‘ and ‘Sentimental Value’ Warner Bros./Focus Features/Neon This new system was developed to encourage members to watch the movies they are given the task of voting on. The trend has been fewer films dominating the nominations, and the numbers bear that out, indicating voters are only concentrating on a few titles. Excluding the three Short and Documentary Feature categories, there are a mere 30 film titles stretched over 20 categories this year out of 317 eligible feature films. Of that number, half of the 30 represent just a single nomination. If you eliminate Animated Feature and Makeup/Hairstyling, you would have just eight films with a single nom, making the gap even wider in 18 key categories. That means there are a mere 15 films that received more than one nomination, a strong indication, as has been true in the recent past, that a paltry number of movies are taking up most of the oxygen, a point proven just by looking at most categories and seeing the same few films listed over and over. What all this says is that in the democracy known as the Motion Picture Academy there are realistically few ways to break in and upset the apple cart. Unless you have a big campaign, or a distributor hell-bent on making a mark like Neon, which buys up every winner in Cannes and winds up with four of the five International Feature nominees, what chance do you have to get through to voters? In asking for transparency from its members, in hoping for honesty, the Academy is clearly aware this has become a contest for the haves and the have nots, and maybe, just maybe, by adding the intimidation level of “requiring” members to see the movies before voting it can begin to make a difference in the level playing field of the winners, and going forward the nominees. For now though it is just a few who will share the glory on Oscar night. And by the way, it is no wonder that David Ellison was so bound and determined to succeed in taking over Warner Bros. It is sad that Paramount, a once great player in this sandbox, has an embarrassing zero nominations (even with the shamefully under-seen Roofman , produced in part by the Academy’s current president Lynette Howell Taylor) while Warners has 30 noms and shares in another four for distributing Apple’s F1. If you can’t beat ’em, buy them. Salute To Oscar’s Underdogs – Class Of ’25 All of this brings me to the true underdogs who are hoping for a miracle come Oscar night, and counting on voters to see their films before sending in a ballot — those one-hit wonders, those single nominations that somehow overcame the odds and got recognition from their peers despite the fact they were in a movie that didn’t register with the Academy otherwise. Let’s look at the acting categories, where a whopping 11 of the 20 acting nominees come from only three films (count ’em, three films): One Battle After Another with four, Sentimental Value with four, and Sinners with three. The ‘Sentimental Value’ team in Cannes Getty The Academy smartly lets the individual branches vote for nominations, but in the finals taking place now until next Thursday, it is the entire Academy that gets to vote in every category (provided they verify they have seen the nominees — see the beginning of this column for details). That means those acting nominees coming from those three films with a combined total 38 nominations overall have a distinct advantage of being seen by all members, not just the branch that invited them to the party. And five of the other acting nominees are also in multi-nominated movies that have all been nominated in Best Picture, a huge advantage. So is there any hope, any hope at all , for those not in a Best Picture nominee and therefore tilting at windmills, climbing the highest mountain, trying to defeat the odds, but praying the new rule designed to make voters testify they see you really works? If it does, can we reasonably expect that Ethan Hawke , Kate Hudson , Rose Byrne and Amy Madigan have a fighting chance? ‘Blue Moon’ Berlin Film Festival Hawke has won widespread praise for his portrayal of musical genius Lorenz Hart in Blue Moon but his, along with Best Original Screenplay, is just one of two nominations for the movie from Sony Pictures Classics, which is not waging the kind of money-ed campaign going for the likes of DiCaprio, Chalamet, and Jordan in more widely seen movies than this terrific little indie. Hawke has, out of necessity, been out there stumping (check out my current The Actor’s Side video interview with him on Deadline), but is it enough? I have talked to voters who bring his name up voluntarily, a good sign, but how many have seen it? Kate Hudson and Hugh Jackman in Craig Brewer’s ‘Song Sung Blue’ Sarah Shatz/Focus Features Hudson, so great in Song Sung Blue, continues to get a robust campaign with billboards and TV ads from Focus Features. But she is up against front-runner Jessie Buckley in Hamnet getting even a bigger campaign from the same distributor, and Hudson is the sole nomination for her film, so its a long shot here. But never say never because 25 years exactly since her first nomination for Almost Famous there is a lot of hometown goodwill for her work. Facing the same odds, but not having nearly the kind of visible campaign support (ala TV, billboards, etc) from A24, Byrne is hoping to ride wins at the Golden Globes and Indie Spirits, as well as deep respect in the industry, to turn her first Best Actress nomination for If I Had Legs I’d Kick You into Oscar gold. It’s a tough assignment since it is the single recognition for the movie that premiered at Sundance 13 months ago, this despite the fact that her co-star Conan O’Brien is again hosting the Academy Awards. He, however, does not control which names are in the envelopes. Conan O’Brien and Rose Byrne in ‘If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’ A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection Finally, in the Supporting categories, every nominee except one out of the 10 is also in a more widely seen Best Picture nominee. That lone exception is veteran Amy Madigan, up for Supporting Actress in Weapons , its only nomination, and in the running again only 40 years since her first and only previous nomination for 1985’s Twice in a Lifetime. This achievement is close to a near record in term of gaps between nominations (Judd Hirsch still holds it at 42 years). The Critics Choice winner is looking for momentum from this weekend’s Actor Awards, but it is still a steep climb, not to mention Weapons being a horror movie and the kind of role that rarely wins Oscars. She’s brilliant in it, so again if voters watched she might have a fighting chance. Amy Madigan as Aunt Gladys in ‘Weapons’ Warner Bros. To give you an idea of the long odds facing these acting nominees in lesser-seen performances, Forest Whitaker was the last to take home Best Actor for a film’s single nomination, for Last King of Scotland in 2006. Julianne Moore in Still Alice was the last to do it in 2014 in the Best Actress category. Christopher Plummer pulled off the feat in 2013 for Beginners, and then before that it was Jack Palance in 1991’s City Slickers , 39 years after his first nomination for Shane. These were all veteran stars long overdue. In Supporting Actress, Penélope Cruz won as the sole nominee for her 2007 film Vicki Cristina Barcelona, but then Woody Allen films had a long track record of delivering in this category. Winning on a single nomination has become so rare that when Marisa Tomei did it for 1992’s My Cousin Vinny, a March release no less, it was considered even then so unlikely that a conspiracy theory lives on to this day suggesting that presenter Palance read off the wrong name.

Tweeting the not-so quiet thing out loud today, Rob Bonta revealed he is in talks with other state (read Blue State) AGs about concerns they have on the absorption of WBD into the corporation owned by Donald Trump ‘s “good friends” David Ellison and his Oracle found father Larry Ellison.

Watch on Deadline Mark, I hear you. I’m in conversation with my AG colleagues about Paramount/Warner Bros. As the epicenter of the entertainment industry, California has a special interest in protecting competition. https://t.co/Av74BFnEsi — Rob Bonta (@AGRobBonta) February 27, 2026 As for Ruffalo himself, who has on more than one occasion ruffled a few feathers with his advocacy, red carpet label pins and outspokenness, the Hulk actor suggested to Bonta to put together a posse. “Please let’s circle up all the State AG’s and talk about how this is going to kill completion in the industry and drive down wages, and product quality for consumers,” Ruffalo posted last night after news of Netflix dropping out of the battle for WBD and Paramount’s 11th hour $110 billion hostile takeover bid getting the Warner’s board nod. “There are lots of agents in Hollywood who can tell you how past mergers and consolidations have hurt their clients and business. There is lots of talent that can tell you the same.” Having already put the brakes late Thursday on any victory laps by Ellison and that other David, WBD CEO David Zaslav in Paramount’s tentative win for all of WBD over Netflix with a stern “not a done deal,” Bonta is now emerging as the top interrogator of this latest Tinseltown Mother Boxes meld. The CA AG’s office didn’t get back to Deadline on what the status of those talks with other state AGs were and who was talking to who. However, sources in Sacramento tell me that it is pretty much the usual suspects of New York, Washington, Virginia and Pennsylvania at this point, with more on the go. Any attempt by state AGs to stop or slow down the Paramount and WBD meld would likely fit in to a competition and consolidation attack. Simply put, in the eyes of Blue State Justice Departments and maybe more, one big PARA-WBD would mean less places for filmmakers and producers to sell to and more power in the hands of one entity to set rates, prices and output. Without any irony on either side, that was pretty much the core of the claims MAGA and others made against Netflix when they were still aiming to buy WB. California Attorney General Rob Bonta at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 6, 2025 (Photo:Getty) As well as fellow Blue Staters, Bonta is also talking to Dems in DC in terms of strategic coordination. Certainly, that tracks with the fiery words Friday of the usually circumspect Sen, Chris Murphy (D-CT) that federal Democrats “are going to break up these anti-democratic information conglomerates” once they get the majority in Congress and in 2028 back in the White House. Sen. Murphy’s pointed remarks follow the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) throwing antitrust shade on Paramount talking over WBD and the role and influence of the CNN-hating Trump administration on the deal and the outcome. With MAGA plans to derail “woke” Netflix from scooping up the WB crown jewels a success, Red State AGs are mute now on their insistence of earlier this week that federal AG Pam Bondi dig deep into possible Sherman Act violations by the streamer. In that context, a February 20 launched monopoly and antitrust probe by the DOJ into Netflix seems moot now. Even before there was a WBD deal for them, Paramount a week ago announced that it had moved past a DOJ antitrust examination and the necessary waiting period. Additionally, moving things along nicely for PSKY for a deal that Zaslav says will close in a year, a March 4 hearing before the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, which roasted Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos earlier this month, has been canceled. That move by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) came as Sen. Booker unsuccessfully sought to have David Ellison show up to testify. The PARA-WBD deal as it stands, has some big baked in payout penalty fees, like the $2.8 billion Paramount already handed Netflix today and the $7 billion the Ellison-owned studio will have to give WBD if the deal fails its regulatory requirements. Also, adding up to millions and millions pretty quickly, there’s a daily “ticking fee” of $0.25 per share per quarter that starts taking effect on September 30, 2026 if the deal hasn’t been finalized by then. So, lots of moving pieces, and lots of AGs. Is Par’s Debt-Laden WBD Takeover Another Ill-Starred Hollywood Sequel?

Despite Thompson’s message, the mood among many at the cable news network on Friday was “beyond bleak,” per one source. Related Stories News Massive Merger Confirmed: Paramount And WBD Reveal Details Of $110 Billion Deal News With Paramount As A Potential New Owner, CNN CEO Mark Thompson Urges Employees, “Don’t Jump To Conclusions About The Future” Paramount has yet to comment on its specific plans for the network after emerging as the winner for WBD , but in the months since Warner Bros Discovery put itself up for sale, there has been rampant speculation about what life will look like if the David Ellison-led company owned CNN. Watch on Deadline Fears only accelerated after the Wall Street Journal reported in December that Ellison made assurances to Trump that he would make major changes to the network, long a target of the president’s. Ellison’s appearance at Trump’s State of the Union address , as a guest of one of his most stalwart congressional supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), probably didn’t help soothe fears of the network’s future editorial direction. “There should be a lot of concern and consternation,” said Frank Sesno, professor at the George Washington School of Media and Public Affairs and former Washington bureau chief for CNN. When Sesno was at the network, he went through two mergers, when Time Warner acquired the network in 1995 and then when AOL bought Time Warner in 2000. Each time, he said, the question was whether corporate interests align and whether that values journalism. This time is different, he said. “Does CNN’s unique global presence matter?” Sesno said. “Given all the politics, and the sturm and drang around the Ellisons, and what we know and what was said, there is reason to be concerned.” As the bidding process was playing out last year, much of the D.C. consensus was that Paramount would emerge the winner, leaving the company with two major news organizations, CBS News and CNN. In the eyes of one veteran, that development could prove to be worse for CBS News than CNN, in part because the latter is heavily unionized, at a time when Paramount will be under pressure to massively reduce costs. Sesno said that the three major areas of concern are the editorial direction, how Paramount combines resources to save money, and the organizational structure. He said that most concerning are the political pressures, as “the Ellisons have made no pretense of being chums with Donald Trump and Donald Trump made no pretense of who he wanted to see victorious in this merger.” Yet Another Period Of Uncertainty CNN finds itself in yet another period of uncertainty, with its parent company already sold twice in the past decade. During his first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s purchase of CNN parent Time Warner, the companies sought to mount a defense of retaliation due to Trump’s hatred of the news network. The DOJ denied it, and the judge declined to allow such an argument. Although AT&T prevailed, the suspicion of Trump’s influence lingered. What’s different about Trump 2.0 is the extent to which efforts to lobby the president for favorable treatment are much more blatant. Trump himself had said that he would be involved in whether the deal gets regulatory approval, breaking from a presidential tradition of keeping arm’s length. Although he later said that he would leave it to the DOJ to decide, earlier this week he was demanding that Netflix fire Susan Rice , one of its board members. The anxiousness over the situation also stems from the way that Skydance’s purchase of Paramount Global went down last year. As they sought to get the deal through regulatory approval, the previous Paramount owners settled Trump’s lawsuit against CBS for $16 million, even though the litigation, over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, was seen by many legal experts as baseless. As it sought the FCC’s greenlight, Skydance committed to an ombudsman to take newsroom complaints. The new Paramount then hired Bari Weiss , founder of the center-right opinion site The Free Press, to take charge of the news division as editor in chief. A number of her changes outlined in her strategy have been directed at regaining a footing as viewer habits shift to streaming and social media, the same challenge that other legacy news outlets have tried to address. But Weiss also put a heavy emphasis on rebuilding trust, a problem that certainly bears out in polls. The Problem Of Trust Sesno said that he agrees that is a major problem for news organizations, not just those that may be perceived as leaning to the left but to those leaning to the right. Where he cautions is over the implication that “in order to build trust, you need to avert your gaze from holding everyone’s feet to the fire.” “We have a false equivalency here that creates confusion in the public’s mind and oversimplifies the problem and the challenge that confronts people seeking to do journalism in the way that it is meant to be done,” he said. The actions to address the problem of trust can in turn create plenty of consternation in news divisions: The assumption often is that it means a shift rightward, something that in turns triggers extra scrutiny from audiences on the left, who may be the more loyal viewers. As CBS News has laid off employees and offered buyouts, some have gone out with stinging rebukes of the new strategy. According to the Guardian , producer Mary Walsh, departing after 46 years this week, wrote to staffers that “maybe it’s for the best. We’ve been told to aim our reporting at a particular part of the political spectrum. Honestly, I don’t know how to do that.” In announcing the merger on Friday afternoon, Paramount’s release touted of being able to “offer complementary portfolio of cable networks spanning entertainment, sports and news will significantly improve cash flow, unlock efficiencies, and strengthen our ability to manage linear market pressures.” There were no specific commitments for CNN. “I’m very worried about the people there,” said Jim Acosta, the former CNN anchor and chief White House correspondent who left last year and launched his own media company. “From everything I hear many of the staffers at CNN work with perpetual job fear.

The formal announcement comes after WBD jilted Netflix, saying it received a Superior Proposal from the David Ellison company. Netflix had four days to match but declined immediately and walked away, leaving Par triumphant after a months-long hostile takeover attempt to pry apart its rivals. Paramount said the merged company is committed to producing a minimum of 30 theatrical films annually — 15 per studio per year. It promised film will receive a full theatrical release, with a minimum 45-day window globally and the current industry standard home video window prior to availability on subscription streaming services. Doubts around Netflix’s ultimate commitment to theatrical and intermediate windows was a major concern fo exhibitors and many in the Hollywood community. Watch on Deadline The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject regulatory clearances and approval by WBD shareholders, with a vote expected in the early spring. Paramount expects over $6 billion in cost synergies, short for cost savings. It cited a “combination of: technology integration (such as migrating the combined company to a single enterprise resource planning system and consolidating streaming technology stacks), corporate-wide efficiencies, including procurement savings, optimizing the combined real estate footprint, and otherwise streamlining operational efficiencies.” Many industry players anticipate thousands of layoffs. The transaction is funded by $47 billion in equity fully backed by the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners. At closing, the equity may include other strategic and financial partners. Paramount did not name them but its previous hostile tender offer included backing from the Public Investment Fund (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), L’imad Holding Company PJSC (Abu Dhabi) and Qatar Investment Authority (Qatar). Affinity Partners, the investment fund of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner , had also been involved but withdrew. Ditto for China’s Tencent. Under the terms of the equity commitments, new shares of Class B Paramount stock will be issued at a price of $16.02 per share. In addition to the new cash equity investment, the transaction is backed by $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo, which includes $15 billion to backstop WBD’s existing bridge facility and $39 billion of incremental new debt. The $54 billion excludes $3.5 billion of bridge financing from these institutions to backstop an existing $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. The combined company will own a film library of more than 15,000 titles and thousands of hours of television programming with franchises including Harry Potter , Mission Impossible , Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, the DC Universe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Transformers, Star Trek and SpongeBob SquarePants . Combined sports rights will include the NFL, Olympics, UFC, PGA Tour, NHL, Big Ten and Big 12 Football, NCAA College Basketball, and Champions League, with the ability to distribute these rights collectively across all of its platforms. The merged company will have a massive portfolio of cable networks. That will include CNN, to the alarm of some lawmakers and many in the news business given shifts at CBS since David Ellison acquired control. The new company will inherit a diverse international portfolio from the former Discovery Communications, present in over 200 countries and territories with cable and free-to-air networks. Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, has stressed technology and today’s announcement promised streamlining of “the technological underpinning of every aspect of the combined company’s businesses.” Paramount said it will be well-positioned to invest in growth, noting marquee deals since the Skydance merger with Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park , the UFC, the Duffer Brothers and Activision. However, Wall Streeters have noted it will carry a huge amount of debt that may constrain investment. “From the very beginning, our pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery has been guided by a clear purpose: to honor the legacy of two iconic companies while accelerating our vision of building a next-generation media and entertainment company. By bringing together these world-class studios, our complementary streaming platforms, and the extraordinary talent behind them, we will create even greater value for audiences, partners and shareholders — and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead,” said Paramount CEO David Ellison. “I’m very pleased with the outcome we achieved for WBD shareholders and the entertainment industry. Our guiding principle throughout this process has been to secure a transaction that maximizes the value of our iconic assets and our century-old studio while delivering as much certainty as possible for our investors.

He began making rapid-fire offers , all rejected , pushing the WBD board to open things up with a formal auction process that resulted in four offers — from Paramount, Netflix, Comcast and one mystery bidder never specified. “This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.” — Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters WBD clinched a a deal to sell Warner Bros’.’ streaming and studio assets to Netflix, a major departure for the streamer that tends to grow organically. Paramount launched a hostile tender offer , threatened a proxy fight and things got noisy. It sweetened its offer several times but continually was rebuffed by WBD until this week. A seven-day negotiating window ended with a new offer that Warner felt was superior to the Netflix deal. Paramount raised its offer price to $31 a share in cash, from $30, but also addressed other concerns raised by the WBD including around financing guarantees. The two sides now are working on the text of a final agreement, which would need approval by WBD shareholders and a green light from regulators in the U.S. and other territories. Hollywood players, Wall Streeters, public interest groups guilds and lawmakers will know, definitively, where to direct their fire. Netflix issued this statement from its co-CEOs Sarandos and Peters: The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid. Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price. Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program. We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.

Discovery , one of its prizes would be CNN . That has triggered a new level of consternation at the network, not just because of the ever-present worries about cutbacks at a time of consolidation, but that CNN would be under the same corporate umbrella as CBS. The broadcast network’s news division is undergoing a transformation since the David Ellison-run Skydance acquired Paramount last year. Related Stories News That’s All, Folks: Netflix Walks Away From Warner Bros., Refusing To Raise Offer News WBD’s David Zaslav Wishes Netflix Well, “Can’t Wait” To Start Working With Paramount “Despite all the speculation you’ve read during this process, I’d suggest that you don’t jump to conclusions about the future until we know more,” CNN’s chairman and CEO Mark Thompson wrote to employees Thursday. Watch on Deadline He added, “And secondly let’s not forget our duty to our audience. We’re still near the start of what is already an incredibly newsy year at home and abroad, one that will culminate with critical U.S. midterm elections and who knows what else. Let’s continue to focus on delivering the best possible journalism to the millions of people who rely on us all around the world.” CNN’s Jake Tapper reported Netflix’s withdrawal from the process on his show on Thursday afternoon, telling viewers, “We have some breaking news internationally that affects everybody I’m looking at right now in the studio.” Democrats already are seeking answers from Ellison on whether he made any guarantees to Donald Trump about changes to CNN, which has long been one of the president’s targets. There also are concerns about editorial direction at CNN. At CBS, Skydance committed to hiring an ombudsman to take complaints about its news coverage. A former head of a conservative think tank, Kenneth Weinstein , was hired in that role. Ellison later tapped Bari Weiss , founder of the center-right site The Free Press, to serve as editor in chief of CBS News. He attended Trump’s State of the Union address this week, as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the president’s allies. Under the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, CNN and other cable networks would have ultimately been spun off into a separate entity. But Paramount’s proposal calls for buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery, creating a media giant. Jim Acosta, the former CNN anchor and host who launched his own media venture, posted on X, “As I’ve been warning, America now has state-compromised media. When 60 Min or CNN is in trouble, we’re all in trouble. Trump has cracked the code in how to hurt the press. Free speech is now at risk. MAGA corporations must not control the news. Support independent media.” Thompson’s full note is below: Dear All, Many of you will have already heard and seen our reporting about today’s two significant pieces of news: first that the board of our parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has decided that Paramount Skydance’s offer to purchase WBD is now the best offer in front of them, and second that Netflix has decided not to increase its own latest offer. David Zaslav is holding a WBD Town Hall Friday to discuss the news – you should already have received an invitation to that. We will hold our own CNN Town Hall as soon as possible after that to discuss next steps and to answer your questions to the best of our ability. I want to end this note with two thoughts: Despite all the speculation you’ve read during this process, I’d suggest that you don’t jump to conclusions about the future until we know more. And secondly let’s not forget our duty to our audience. We’re still near the start of what is already an incredibly newsy year at home and abroad, one that will culminate with critical U.S. midterm elections and who knows what else. Let’s continue to focus on delivering the best possible journalism to the millions of people who rely on us all around the world.
