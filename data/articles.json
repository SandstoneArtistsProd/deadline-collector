Sam Smith has kicked off his residency at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco , with the singer’s 20-date stint helping to officially usher in a new era for the historic landmark. First erected in 1922, the Castro closed in 2024 for a reported $41 million renovation project. But the century-old Spanish-style Baroque theatre is open for business — and music — once again, with its gilded ceiling and ornamental walls restored to its original design, while seating is now reconfigurable for different events, including 650 seats that can be removed to create more standing room space (like for Smith’s concert). More importantly, city officials hope the re-opening of the Castro Theatre will also help revive the predominantly queer neighborhood it sits in, which shares a name with the venerable venue.

Other artists set to play at the Castro this spring include Father John Misty, José González, Santigold and Lucy Dacus. The Castro will also help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the LGBTQ-themed Frameline Film Festival this June. ALSO AVAILABLE Castro Theatre Tickets on Vivid Seats FIND TICKETS HERE Smith’s residency runs until March 14. According to tourism officials and local businesses, Smith’s new Castro residency and the reopening of the theatre has already helped to bring in a number of new visitors to the area. Mat Schuster, the executive chef and owner of long-time neighborhood fixture, Canela, says business has been “very busy” in the last few weeks, crediting Smith’s show with bringing out new diners to the Spanish restaurant, which has been on Market Street since 2011. Other local hotspots like wine bar Bar49, the San Francisco outpost of Hi Tops, and the women’s sports bar, Rikki’s (named after Gay Games Federation founder Rikki Streicher), were all packed on a recent evening following Smith’s Castro concert. According to San Francisco Tourism, the reopening of The Castro Theatre is poised to deliver “meaningful economic gains” to the surrounding neighborhood, which some stats estimating that the venue will draw more than 200,000 visitors annually. With the Castro Theatre now open again, local officials are looking ahead to other upcoming celebrations, including a planned reimagining of the Castro and Market Street intersection into The Memorial at Harvey Milk Plaza, honoring the first openly gay elected official in California (and the inspiration for the 2009 Sean Penn film ). Milk’s legacy is already enshrined at the San Francisco airport of course, with terminal 1 at SFO renamed as the “Harvey Milk Terminal;” the new memorial is scheduled to be completed by 2028. The annual Castro Street Fair, meantime, a community street celebration founded by Harvey Milk in 1974, will take place on the first weekend of October. The reopening of the Castro comes amidst a busy few months for San Francisco, which recently saw a number of athletes and celebrities in town for the Super Bowl . Steph Curry’s new speakeasy, The Eighth Rule, was among the hotspots over the big game weekend and the basketball star’s bourbon-forward bar continues to be a hot reservation in the city. Opened in the fall, the bar is tucked away in a nondescript hallway inside the Westin St. Francis hotel in Union Square, offering an intimate and exclusive setting for the Golden State Warriors point guard’s Gentleman’s Cut Bourbon , which can be ordered on its own or as part of a six-course omakase-style cocktail tasting (we loved the clarified coconut milk punch and the truffle-vanilla whiskey sour). Of course, guests can also order cocktails a la carte, choosing from different bourbons and whiskeys, plus a full selection of other spirits. Next door to The Eighth Rule is Bourbon Steak San Francisco, the latest outpost of Chef Michael Mina’s award-winning steakhouse. The restaurant marks the celebrity chef’s return to the Westin St. Francis, where he opened his first eponymous restaurant in 2004. In addition to its selection of steaks, seafood and caviar offerings (like Mina’s famous “caviar twinkee”), this Bourbon Steak outpost offers a family-style dining experience for six people, available through advance reservations. This is the only Bourbon Steak location to offer this communal table format. New this month is the highly-anticipated opening of JouJou, an elevated French brasserie concept from the owners of the two Michelin-starred Lazy Bear. Located in the city’s Design District, JouJou is poised to be the next celebrity hangout, with its ornate dining room and marble-topped counters setting the scene for steak frites and star sightings alike. As chef David Barzelay told the San Francisco Chronicle when asked about the inspiration for JouJou: “It always feels like you’re just in a place where it’s happening.” THR"

SNL Logo text Connor Storrie has officially made his Saturday Night Live debut. The 26-year-old actor was absent from the Trump-centric cold open, entering onto the stage for his monologue to loud cheers. “Now, some of you may have seen all of me on my show Heated Rivalry ,” he joked to the audience. “It’s a show that’s taught a lot people about hockey, and it’s taught a lot of straight women that their sexuality is actually gay men.” Storrie, who admitted to crying when he booked the show, lamented on the fact he was born to be there before joking that he wasn’t sure he pulled off the hockey portion of Heated Rivalry . He then brought out Quinn and Jack Hughes from the U.S. men’s hockey team and Hilary Knight and Megan Keller from the U.S. women’s hockey team.

The monologue didn’t shy away from taking a dig at the video that showed the men’s hockey team laughing along with President Trump as he told them that the women’s team would have to join the men’s team at the White House. “It was going to be just us, but we thought we’d invite the guys too” and “we thought we’d give them a little moment to shine” were the highlights from Knight and Keller, along with the reminder that the last time the men’s team won was over 40 years ago, while the last time the women won was two Olympics ago. The monologue ended with everyone looking cheery together.

The internet had been speculating throughout the week if the 25-year-old Canadian actor would join his onscreen beau for a guest appearance. The sketch found a couple hashing through a rejected proposal. Storrie, alongside the SNL cast members, in the sketch yelled about someone finally showing up. Williams then slid onto the ice and into Storrie, met with huge cheers from the audience. The actor also lated joined Storrie in announcing musical guest Mumford & Sons together. anything can happen at the rink pic.twitter.com/WM4hfKM5IT — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) March 1, 2026 The pair have repeatedly spoken about how close the experience of making Heated Rivalry has made them. “I have one of my best friends for life right beside me through it all, which is already a luxury that a lot of actors don’t get,” Williams previously told The Hollywood Reporter . “I’m sure I would’ve probably had a smaller appetite for the amount of stuff we’re doing if I didn’t have him through this.” SNL went all in on Storrie leading up to Saturday’s show, which featured Mumford & Sons as the musical guest. The sketch comedy series released its typical two teasers — the first showing Storrie partaking in an “accent duel” and the second showing him “making out” with cast member Sarah Sherman and Mumford & Sons. The show also released a charming blooper reel of the actor’s first teaser. Storrie’s SNL debut comes just months after his breakout role in the queer hockey drama, Heated Rivalry . Hailing from Canadian streamer Crave and airing on HBO Max in the U.S., the series centers on a fictional hockey universe based on popular romance books by Rachel Reid. Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney created, wrote and directed the series. Heated Rivalry focuses on two rival professional players — Canada-born Shane Hollander (Williams) of the fictitious Montreal Metros and Russia-born Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) of the fictitious Boston Raiders — as they navigate a near-decade-long situationship- turned-relationship. The show has made certified stars out of both Storrie and Williams. The pair began last month presenting at the Golden Globes and closed the month serving as torchbearers in the 2026 Olympic Torch Relay. Storrie’s seemingly already found his first post- Heated Rivalry role; he’s in talks to join the ensemble cast of Molly Gordon and SNL writer Allie Levitan’s A24 comedy Peaked . Williams has also found his next role, re-teaming with Crave for the Carrie-Anne Moss-led series, Yaga . Crave renewed Heated Rivalry for a second season early into the show’s first season run. HBO Max has confirmed it will continue to air the series. The show is slated to shoot the second season this summer — Tierney said it would shoot in August on a recent TV appearance. It’s aiming for a spring 2027 release , Bell Media and Crave told THR in a statement. Reid announced earlier this year that she’ll be publishing her seventh book in the Game Changers series, which Heated Rivalry and its sequel The Long Game belong to. The book, Unrivaled , will be the next chapter in Shane and Ilya’s story. She announced earlier this week that she’d be pushing the book to a 2027 release date. Ryan Gosling will host next week’s episode of SNL , where he’ll be joined by musical guest Gorillaz. And on March 14, Harry Styles will pull double duty as host and musical guest . THR"

Current Paramount chairman and CEO Ellison, who has been in the news in recent days for the mega merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery, is a licensed pilot for helicopter aviation, aerobatics and more. Warner, of course, was the founder and president of Warner Bros. Studios. Related Stories Movies PGA Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: 'Sinners' Dominates With 13 Wins, Including Best Motion Picture Diller, a longtime friend of Blum’s, continued: “Cecil B. DeMille, Disney, and now Blum: Not the most obvious succession, but then you also gave this award to Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves. So there’s that.” Diller continued his introduction by making quips at Blum’s “cheapness.” Of course, Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse (behind horror franchises like P aranormal Activity , Insidious , The Black Phone , The Purge ), is well known for investing small amounts of money in films and giving directors their creative freedom. For example, 2007’s Paranormal Activity was made for just $15,000 but grossed almost $200 million worldwide. “There’s some commonality with the greats,” Diller continued. “DeMille made movies for $15,000 and so did Blum almost 100 years later. To say he’s cheap isn’t a characterization. It’s a defining attribute. … I’m giving this award to Jason, not because I like horror movies; I actually hate them. But because we’ve been friends since before he matriculated, if that’s the right word to describe working for Harvey Weinstein. How he found his groove after that is anyone’s guess, but he sure did find it.” Blum served as an executive for Bob and Harvey Weinstein at their production company Miramax before becoming an independent producer at Paramount and founding Blumhouse Productions in 2000. Diller continued: “300 films made on the lowest pay scales in film history, but he also did something quite extraordinary in itself, and that’s helping artists tell stories and helping them make a lot of money. … Once Jason found his calling, he focused with an intensity that is rare in this business, and that’s worth saying because Hollywood is essentially a machine that’s designed to distract you. There’s always a bigger budget being dangled in front of you, a more prestigious kind of movie that will get you an awards campaign or a franchise that someone swears is going to change everything. The shiny objects in this town are endless. Jason though stayed focused on scary and people betting on themselves … Jason is this odd something of a Renaissance man, a true embodiment of a man [who] can do all things if it is his will. And it is his will and his stick to perseverance of what he believes in and how essentially honest and honorable he has been that makes me ever so glad to be able to present this award to him.” When Blum took the stage to accept the Milestone Award, he joked, “I think my biggest achievement is getting Barry Diller to the PGAs!” “Barry’s been a friend of mine for a long time and a mentor of mine and someone I admire so, so much,” he added. “And he’s changed my life is a lot of ways.” During his acceptance speech, the horror mogul also talked about how AI cannot replicate the passions and tastes of a producer. “We’re living at this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream in the mood we’re in next Tuesday. But what machines can’t do?” He then brought up the success of Heated Rivalry , noting, “If you would ask an algorithm a few months ago to predict a low-budget gay hockey romance with zero known stars, I promise you the algorithm would have been like, ‘Do not make that show.’ But that’s why Heated Rivalry needed us. It needed producers.” Blum added that he even invited the hit show’s producers to be his guests at the show, but they were in New York to watch Connor Storrie host Saturday Night Live .

The 2026 Producers Guild Awards have been handed out, with One Battle After Another continuing its winning streak and taking home the night’s top award. The Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures has historically served as the best predictor of who will win best picture at the Oscars, because of the similar membership size between PGA and the Academy, and both of their use of the weighted preferential ballot. Bugonia , F1 , Frankenstein , Hamnet , Marty Supreme , One Battle After Another , Sentimental Value , Sinners , Train Dreams and Weapons were nominees for that honor, but One Battle was crowned the winner.

You kept your head down and you protected me; Ryan [Coogler], I’ll speak for you, protected Ryan, protected Zach [Creggar]. You’ve done an incredible job protecting us,” he said in his acceptance speech. “That’s real producing too — getting us out of the gate, letting us do our work, protecting us through the distribution and leading us here. And so whatever the road lies ahead, your work this year is so spectacular. I share this with you. None of us could have done this without the two of you guys and the entire team that you have around you. Long may you wave, whatever the future holds.

KPop Demon Hunters , The Pitt , The Studio , My Mom Jayne: A Film by Mariska Hargitay and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert are among those who also took home statues. Four awards were handed out ahead of Saturday night’s ceremony, with Formula 1: Drive to Survive , Sesame Street , Adolescence: The Making of Adolescence and The Wizard of Oz as those early winners.

Macy and Wumni Mosaku. PGA executive director Susan Sprung kicked off the evening, acknowledging the events of the last 24 hours in the Middle East and “praying for peace.” She also addressed the recent deal for Paramount to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, saying, “I know all of us are also thinking about the future of one of our most storied studios and its implications for our industry more broadly. Please note that the guild’s position has not changed. We will continue to call on regulators for the scrutiny and ultimately the safeguards and protections that producers need, that everyone in this business deserves, and that are the right of those who consume what we create. The vitality of our industry is at stake and on that producers will not be silent.” Ralph Farquhar was on hand to present to Brock Akil, who told the room, “I have spent over three decades working inside systems that were not built with me in mind — learning them, navigating them, stretching them. I am deeply grateful to every collaborator, every writer in every writers room, every cast and crew member who trusted me with their talent, their time and their dreams.” Later in the show , Barry Diller appeared to present to Blum, as the horror mogul acknowledged, “We’re living at this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream in the mood we’re in next Tuesday.

And to close out the night, Greta Gerwig presented Pascal with her special honor, gushing that the producer was “the person I dreamed I would meet when I came to Hollywood: a gorgeous, wild, genius woman.” Pascal had the crowd laughing with her speech, particularly when she acknowledged that “the way I became a producer was pretty fucked, and then I got lucky, and then it was all really hard anyway.” She continued that there are many challenges to being a producer, including “knowing that no matter how bad things get, how many mistakes you made, how many failures you have, it’s never really over, no matter what anyone tells you.” A complete list of this year’s winners follows.

Pictures Chiefs By Jordan Moreau Plus Icon Jordan Moreau Latest ‘One Battle After Another’ Takes Producers Guild Award as Paul Thomas Anderson Pays Emotional Tribute to Warner Bros. Pictures Chiefs 6 hours ago ‘Hamnet’ Sets Peacock Streaming Release Date Ahead of Oscars 2 days ago Box Office: ‘Scream 7’ Makes $7.8 Million in Previews, Highest Ever for Franchise 2 days ago See All Variety “ One Battle After Another ” took home the Producers Guild Award for theatrical motion picture, adding to its near-sweep of major kudos in the build up to the Academy Awards on March 15. “One Battle” director-producer Paul Thomas Anderson capped an emotional night by paying tribute to the leaders of the studio that championed his offbeat, politically charged film. Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy were in the room at the Fairmont Century Plaza as Anderson made oblique references to the drama surrounding the sale of the studio’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

I share this with you. Long may you wave, whatever the future holds. It is one battle after another,” Anderson said. He praised the pair for championing original material and unconventional filmmakers, such as Ryan Coogler and Zach Cregger, whose films “ Sinners ” and “Weapons” were also nommed for the top PGA honor. Popular on Variety De Luca and Abdy deserve “to get an award for enduring a lot — a lot — on the road to get these films made,” Anderson said. “You kept your head down and you protected me. You protected Ryan. You protected Zach. That’s real producing. Letting us do our work and leading us here.” The night’s other top winners included Apple TV’s “The Studio” and HBO Max’s “The Pitt,” for episodic comedy and drama, respectively. Neflix’s “Adolescence” added another trophy to its long list of wins by prevailing for limited series. Susan Sprung, CEO of the PGA, opened the event on a somber note with a nod to the U.S. military action that has unfolded over the past day. “The events of the past 24 hours have us all concerned,” Sprung told the crowd at the Fairmont Century Plaza hotel. “Even as we go about our lives, even as we celebrate, forever, we pray for peace.” Sprung also made a reference to the drama that has engulfed Warner Bros., one of Hollywood’s foundational studios, with Paramount Skydance making a successful eleventh-hour bid for the company, prompting Netflix to bow out of the deal it reached in December. Sprung did not cite WBD by name but said that the guild was keeping watch on the impact of the consolidation of two of Hollywood’s major studios — Paramount and Warner Bros. — and its impact on the creative community. Sprung told the crowd that the PGA’s position on the WBD-Paramount deal is to advocate for a thorough regulatory process to apply the scrutiny and safeguard and protections that producers need and everyone in this business deserves, and for the rights of everyone who consumes what we create,” she said. The honorary kudos that were presented provided some of the most poignant moments on a night when winners made reference to the challenges that Hollywood and the entertainment industry face in a moment of rapid change. Showrunner Mara Brock Akil delivered an emotional speech as she accepted the Norman Lear Achievement Award from her early mentor, writer-producer Ralph Farquhar. Brock Akil, who is one of the most prominent Black showrunners and series creators in TV, noted that she has spent the past 35 years “working inside systems that were not built with me in mind.” “As producers we are architects of imagination. That is not small work,” she said. “It is a profound privilege to tell stories about love.” Brock Akil emphasized that at this stage of her career her greatest contribution is helping to nurture inexperienced writers from underrepresented backgrounds. “If I have done anything to deserve this award it is that I helped make room for more voices. Room for fuller humanity. Room for stories that once waited quietly at the margins,” she said. Prolific producer Jason Blum received the PGA’s Milestone Award for his contributions in forging a new business model for film production. His kudo was introduced by none other than Barry Diller, who gave the honoree a few jabs before hailing his success in building his Blumhouse studio as an independent operation. Diller said flatly that he “hated” horror movies but has been friendly with Blum for years. (Diller also took a thinly veiled shot at Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison, who is a pilot, when he made reference to Jack L. Warner: “What would Jack Warner do to know he’d been succeeded by a stunt pilot?”) “When Jason’s on our boat he behaves like tourist at an all-inclusive resort,” Diller joked. But he also praised him “as something of a Renaissance man. He is the true embodiment that a man can do all things if he will.” Blum paid tribute to his parents, both 95, who were in the audience. He shared a long yarn about how his father was early to recognize the genius of Andy Warhol in the late 1950s when Irving Blum ran an art gallery in Los Angeles. Irving Blum took the leap of buying Warhol’s first set of 32 paintings of Campbell’s Soup cans – long before they were iconic examples of pop art. Blum compared his father’s faith in Warhol to the faith that producers need to get movie and TV series made. He noted how “impossible” people in Hollywood can be, particularly creative artists. The producer’s ultimate job is to wrangle all of that impossible-ness to get a production to the finish line. “Somehow, we’re here to bring all of us impossible people together. To keep the team intact. To keep the soup cans intact even though it would’ve been faster and more lucrative to sell them individually.” Veteran studio executive turned producer Amy Pascal was celebrated with the David O. Selznick Achievement Award. Greta Gerwig, director of “Barbie” and the upcoming “Chronicles of Narnia” adaptation for Netflix, spoke from the heart as she described how Pascal supported her audacious desire to write and direct 2019’s “Little Women,” which established Gerwig as a director to watch. “I’m floored by the faith she placed in me,” Gerwig said. “Nothing in this world that gives me more joy than when Amy loves something.” Pascal was characteristically blunt in discussing her evolution from Sony Pictures chief to producer in the wake of the drama that ensued at the studio after the 2014 hack of its email systems by agents of North Korea. Pascal was forced out of her executive role by the fallout. But she has since rebounded with her success as a busy producer shepherding high-profile projects including Gerwig’s “Narnia” film. “The way I became a producer was pretty fucked. And then I got lucky,” Pascal said, citing friends and industry associates who helped her make the transition. Pascal then reeled off a few truisms about producing that she has learned over the past decade. “Being a producer is doing Jedi mind tricks outside a Port-a-Potty wearing three sets of handwarmers,” she said. “Being a producer is knowing there’s no such thing as a great movie without a great director.” Perhaps most important, she added, being a producer means having the self-confidence to know “it’s never really over no matter what anyone tells you.” Earlier in the week, PGA winners in sports, children and short-form programming categories were announced. “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” “Sesame Street” and “Adolescence: The Making of Adolescence” won those three categories, respectively. The producing team behind “The Wizard of Oz at Sphere” won the PGA Innovation Award. Lydia Dean Pilcher (“Queen of Katwe,” “Radium Girls”) also received the Vance Van Petten Entrepreneurial Spirit Producing Award.

(Or at least for the last time for the next three years.) To the surprise of probably few people, the awards program will henceforth be known as “The Trump Kennedy Center Honors,” in keeping with the effort of the board installed by President Donald J. Trump to rebrand everything related to the institution with his name. The show will also take place at an alternative, smaller venue for at least the next couple of years, and not at the historic hall in Washington, D.C. that was had its own name change to give the president top billing, under authority that is still disputed by many experts. Related Stories 'Bridgerton' Costume Designers on Making the Lady in Silver 'Forgettable,' 'Sexier' Maid Uniforms and Benedict's Leather Bracelet Series Creators Push Back as the Industry Gets ‘Nervous’ About Important Stories and Female Perspective: ‘The Content Might Be Different Enough to Actually Make a Difference’ The program “will definitely go forward,” said Richard Grenell , the president of the center, in an interview with D.C. news radio station WTOP. “It will probably just be in a smaller venue, which just means ticket demand will be even higher.” Popular on Variety The new location for “The Trump Kennedy Center Honors” “is yet to be determined,” but “we’re already looking for different places,” Grenell told the news station. The Washington Post confirmed Grenell’s radio revelation about the name change and move with representatives of the center on Saturday. The reason the show will have to find a different home is due to the fact that the Kennedy Center – or Trump Kennedy Center, depending on where you stand — is set to close for a couple of years for an extensive and controversial overhaul. Grenell’s announcement of the closure, scheduled to take place this year, followed a series of news reports about withdrawals from the center by cultural institutions or individual artists that left its calendar for 2026 severely underpopulated. Some who have decried the politicization of the center under the Trump administration have held that the highly unexpected move to submit the center to an extensive makeover is a cover for the inability to draw top acts and full houses amid the current polarization, although Grenell has maintained that it is because the building is dilapidated. The most recent broadcast of what was then still called “ The Kennedy Center Honors ” was hosted by Trump and saluted artists who have a friendly relationship with the president. Trump said that he wanted to weed out “wokesters” from receiving the honors, and noted that the five recipients — Kiss, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and Michael Crawford — “all went through me.” The president predicted that the first “Kennedy Center Honors” to feature him as host and curator., broadcast on Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would be “the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done.” That did not come to pass, as the 48th annual show delivered the lowest ratings in the history of the program. It was down by 26 percent from the year before, with Nielsen reporting an average 4.1 million viewers. The ratings were not a concern to the center, according to Roma Daravi, VP of public relations for the center, who said in a statement: “Comparing this year’s broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias… The program performed extremely well across key demographics and platforms, despite industry and timing disadvantages, including a Tuesday air date two days before Christmas… With overall television usage down roughly 20% year over year, the broadcast still tied for the No. 1 spot among adults aged 25–54, alongside a live NBA doubleheader.” Trump spoke to the news about the Kennedy Center’s impending closure at a February news conference, saying he plans to keep the exterior of the building as it is, but making no such promises for the interior. “I’m not ripping it down,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure.” Touting the $200 million renovation, he added, “It’s in very bad shape… sort of dangerous.” He promised the renovated center will feature “the highest-grade marbles, the highest-grade everything… I think there won’t be anything like it in the country.” Naturally, many eyes will be on not just where the “Trump Kennedy Centers” lands as it exits its longtime home, but who the president will secure for a second set of hand-picked or -chosen recipients in the arts. Most of the honorees selected for the 2025 honors do not have fan bases that would likely rise up against them being associated with Trump, although the band Cheap Trick, which performed in honor of their old friends in Kiss, suffered a significant backlash on social media just for playing at the event. Grenell has argued that is only the left that is politicizing the center, although he is not shy about sharing his political beliefs as director, sometimes using his X account to post dozens of pro-MAGA or anti-Democrat tweets per day.

Following the cold open , Storrie — who plays Russian hockey player Ilya Rozanov on HBO’s hit hockey romance TV series “Heated Rivalry” opposite Hudson Williams as Canadian hockey star Shane Hollander — kicked off his monologue, saying: “I am so excited to be here. Now, some of you may have seen literally all of me on my show. It’s a show that has taught a lot of people about hockey, and it’s taught a lot of straight women that their sexuality is actually gay guy.” Related Stories 'Bridgerton' Star Yerin Ha on Sophie and Benedict's Two Very Different Sex Scenes, Hoping for 'Benophie Babies' in Future Seasons 'Bridgerton' Star Katie Leung on Embracing Her Role as Season 4 Villain Lady Araminta: 'I Love That People Love to Hate Her' After making a few more jokes about the cultural phenomenon surrounding “Heated Rivalry” and expressing excitement over the explosive rise in his acting career that’s brought him to “ Saturday Night Live ,” Storrie brought out brothers and USA men’s hockey stars Quinn and Jack Hughes, who said they’ve been too busy with the Olympics to watch the show yet. Popular on Variety “It’s about hockey, right?” Quinn Hughes said. “Kind of,” Storrie joked. “I got my teeth knocked out in the finals, does that happen in your show?” Jack Hughes said. “Metaphorically,” Storrie responded with a knowing smirk. When Storrie said he hoped “some hockey players watched it,” USA women’s hockey stars Megan Keller and Hilary Knight came out on stage to roaring applause from Storrie, the Hughes brothers and the Studio 8H audience. “Don’t worry, we saw your show,” Keller said, once the cheers had settled down. Knight joked that, “it was gonna be just us” who joined Storrie on “SNL,” “but we thought we’d invite the guys, too.” “Yeah, we thought we’d give them a little moment to shine,” Keller added. The bit was a reference to a controversy that started when the men’s hockey team won at the Olympics, and Donald Trump called to invite them to attend the State of the Union address. Recordings circulated of Trump’s phone call with the team, during which he could be heard saying, “I must tell you, we’re gonna have to bring the women’s team — you do know that,” adding that he felt if he didn’t invite them, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.” Everyone was then heard laughing. Following the call, the women’s team declined to attend the State of the Union address. Since then, the men’s hockey team players have received backlash from fans for their reaction to Trump’s comments and not speaking up on behalf of the women’s team. During his “SNL” monologue, Storrie congratulated all the players on gold-medaling at the recent Olympics. “Thanks, the last time the men did that was 46 years ago,” Quinn Hughes said. Knight added with pride: “And the last time we did that was two whole Olympics ago.” “Nice burn,” Jack Hughes said, adding: “But these gold medals aren’t just for us, they’re for all hockey fans. Yours too.” Storrie asked if that meant he, a fictional hockey star, could touch one, to which all four responded: “No.” Watch Storrie’s “SNL” monologue featuring the women’s and men’s USA hockey team players in the video below.

In the Feb. 28 cold open, Trump (played by James Austin Johnson) gives a press conference about the military action. “It’s me, Donald Trump , FIFA Peace Prize winner and Nobel Peace Prize taker,” he began. “Remember that? I launched this attack after me and my board of peace…we were bored of peace. A little wordplay there, did you catch it? As we all know, Iran has been two weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon for like the last 15 years or something. So we had to act now, and we’re doing war.” Trump soon brought out his secretary of war Pete Hegseth (played by Colin Jost) to speak on the military action. Popular on Variety “They asked for someone to volunteer to receive his half-baked operation, and I didn’t walk — I ran,” Jost-as-Hegseth said. “President Trump called me at two in the morning, and you know, I was awake, sober AF.” Hegseth then admitted that “I don’t know what I’m doing.” “Heated Rivalry” star Connor Storrie was the host of the Feb. 28 show, with Mumford & Sons as the musical guest.

During a sketch filmed outside the Rink at Rockefeller Center, Storrie played a guy on a bachelor party, ice skating and having fun with his friends. Meanwhile, a couple (Tommy Brennan and Veronika Slowikowska) discussed their relationship — he proposed, she said no, and they got into a fight. However, he couldn’t help but get distracted by the group having fun — Storrie, Mikey Day and Ben Marshall.

Popular on Variety Later, the group skated in a four-person train, and Williams says it’s the most fun he’s ever had. At the end of the sketch, Brennan hopped into the rink, ditching his now-ex to celebrate with the guys he didn’t know. A few moments later on “ SNL ,” Williams came back out to introduce Mumford and Sons, alongside Storrie. The duo is best known for playing hockey duo Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander on the steamy series, produced by Crave. The hockey drama is based on Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” book series. “Now, some of you may have seen literally all of me on my show. It’s a show that has taught a lot of people about hockey, and it’s taught a lot of straight women that their sexuality is actually gay guy,” Storrie said when he opened the show . He later brought out both the women’s and men’s Olympic hockey teams. “I got my teeth knocked out in the finals. Does that happen in your show?” Jack Hughes asked Storrie, who cheekily responded, “Metaphorically.” “Heated Rivalry,” which aired on HBO Max, became a massive hit for the streamer in its first season. The second season will begin production in August , with an expected release date of April 2027. Warner Bros.

This past week it won 10 Annie Awards including best feature and three Visual Effects Society trophies. It also won the Producers Guild award .

Production designer Thomas E. Sanders, (”Saving Private Ryan” and “Bram Stoker’s Dracula”) was inducted posthumously into the ADG Hall of Fame. The guild handed out four Lifetime Achievement Awards. Honorees included set designer and art director Jann Engel. Production designer Bo Welch. Production designer Tom Southwell and scenic artist Stephen McNally. Welch whose credits include “Men in Black,” “The Birdcage” and “Beetlejuice” dedicated his award to “my brilliant beautiful wife Catherine O’Hara and our sons Matthew and Luke, who all inspire me daily and are my greatest lifetime achievement.” O’Hara died on last month at her Los Angeles home, and was married to Welch. During her speech Friedman vowed to defend the film and television industry. Friedman who has been fighting for a national film credit, started her speech by talking about how films show the world what America is. “It’s why people was in immigrate here in the first place. It’s why people in other countries that don’t enjoy those freedoms understand what that would mean to their lives and to the lives of their children. So what you do does move hearts and minds.” Friedman told the room she had stopped reading from the teleprompter, and was speaking from the heart. She said, “We are going to finish the job of having a national film tax credit, because Hollywood is worth fighting for. The film industry is worth fighting for.” She said, “I will defend this industry. I will defend it from offshoring productions. I will defend it as much as I can from corporate consolidation. I will absolutely defend it from AI taking away the work of artists.” Friedman continued, “We’re going to fight for it in Georgia, New York, New Jersey, all across this country, because when we have a strong film and TV industry, America succeeds. So we are going to continue working on this tax credit. I have great faith that we are going to deliver for you.” Chu was mourning the end of his “Wicked” journey. As he accepted his award, he said, “Have you ever put so much love into something like true love that you never wanted it to end like it hurts, like it physically hurts your stomach to think about your life without it.” He said, “That’s where I’m at right now with ‘Wicked.’ That’s what it feels like for me to say goodbye to ‘Wicked,’ because this may be one of the last times I get to celebrate it.” He talked about the craft of production design and called on those who he had worked with throughout his career from Nelson Coates (“In the Heights”) to Nathan Crowley (“Wicked”). Chu called filmmaking “an empathy exercise built into our culture for generations, and design is what makes it possible. It is the official language of this connection.” He told the room of production designer and set decorators, “You are not simply designers.

Warner Bros. Through her reimagined take on the iconic Frankenstein bride character, Maggie Gyllenhaal says the upcoming horror/sci-fi crime flick The Bride! cannot skirt past the issue of consent as a central thesis in the film. “In the mythology of the Bride of Frankenstein , that’s the major issue,” she told Deadline at the London-held world premiere of the movie. “I can’t make a movie about the bride of Frankenstein without consent being really on the table because she fundamentally has no say in it. You could say, on some level, we don’t have much say in being born either, but we’re not born as grown women.

Peter Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal round out the cast. The Bride! — which debuts in theaters March 6 — is inspired by the 1935 sequel Bride of Frankenstein , in itself a loose adaptation of a side-plot first introduced in Mary Shelley’s indelible 1818 work. In the original sci-fi novel, Victor Frankenstein is beseeched by his creation to create a companion, but after being plagued by visions of what this second attempt may bring (namely the breeding of additional monsters), the scientist destroys the companion before it is brought to life. ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

Stories are infrastructure. They shape how we see ourselves. They shape how we see each other, and they shape what we believe is possible,” she said. “As producers, we are architects of imagination. That is not small work. The characters we center, the worlds we normalize, the dignities we extend, those choices ripple.” It is “a profound privilege,” Akil said, “to tell stories about love: love of family, love of friendship, love of co-workers, ambition, vulnerability, and joy. Stories that insisted on nuance for stereotypes once lived. That work was never about representation. It was about expansion.” Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List: 'The Studio' & 'Colbert' Take Early Categories - Updating Live News PGA's Daryl F. Zanuck Outstanding Producer Nominees Talk Shop Before Awards Show: \"Producing Is Hard, It Is Ghetto\" At this stage of her journey, she continued, “I feel called to build differently, to create structures where the next generation of storytellers don’t have to push as hard just to be heard, to create ecosystems, not just shows. I think about this not only as a producer, but as a mother.” Watch on Deadline Now young men, her sons are watching the show tonight. “They are forming their ideas about leadership, partnership, power, and integrity. And one day, they and their generation will shape whatever comes next. What are we leaving them with?” she asked. “I don’t want them to inherit an industry that requires extraordinary resilience just to belong. I want them to inherit one that assumes their brilliance from the start.” “If I have done anything worthy of this honor, I hope it is this — that I helped make room,” Akil continued. “Room for more voices. Room for fuller humanity. Room for stories that once waited quietly at the margins. Because stories change culture. But space, space changes, who gets to tell it.” Akil began her remarks by paying tribute to one of her great mentors, Ralph Farquhar, who presented her with tonight’s honor. “Ralph, thank you for being with me tonight. It’s an honor to thank you in front of this illustrious audience for teaching me how to make television,” she said. “You told me, one part talent, two parts integrity, and three parts hard work, especially when no one is looking. Mix it up. Bake it at joy. Add some gratitude. And for those last 15 minutes, turn that bad boy up until I’ve exhausted the privilege of telling the story, but still have enough energy left to be thrilled, in awe even, that the little idea I have could rise into a television series worth watching. I am so proud to be a part of your family tree.” Countless talents have come up under Farquhar’s stewardship, she said, naming the many occasions where she worked with him. “34 years ago, as your stage PA on The Sinbad Show , 32 years ago as your writer’s trainee on South Central , 30 years ago as a staff writer on Moesha , you gave me a place to develop and shine,” she shared. “I pitched nonstop, but you never told me to shut up. You did tell me to save it for my pilot, and I did. And it’s called Girlfriends . You recognized my gift for placing music, and I still owe you receipts for all those CDs I bought at Tower Records. They’re out of business, but thank God you’re still here.” Akil remembered being terrified the first time Farquhar asked her to “laugh the show,” explaining, “for those of you in earlier generations, that’s where you enhanced the laughs on a comedy show.” What Akil didn’t realize when Farquhar entrusted her with this responsibility, she said, was that it marked “the beginning of my journey as a producer.” She said she takes that title seriously and is “filled with tremendous gratitude for this once-in-a-lifetime honor” from the PGA. Continued Akil, “Ralph, when you hired me when I was young, ambitious, and probably a little impatient, you didn’t just give me a job. You gave me proximity to possibility. You taught me that producing is not about power, it’s about stewardship, protecting the story, protecting the people who make it, and sometimes protecting the truth from fear. Thank you for seeing me before the industry fully did.” Speaking further of Lear, Akil told the crowd, “Nothing can be more meaningful than to be honored in the name of the late, great Norman Lear. Norman didn’t just produce television, he produced conversation. He disrupted comfort. He invited America to see itself sometimes beautifully, sometimes uncomfortably, but always honestly. That standard shaped me.” Elsewhere in her remarks, she said, “I have spent over three decades working inside systems that were not built with me in mind, learning them, navigating them, stretching them, and I am deeply grateful to every collaborator, every writer in every writer’s room, every cast and crew member who trusted me with their talent, their time, and their dreams.” Known for creating series like Girlfriends , The Game , and Forever , Akil is one of three big honorees tonight, the others being Amy Pascal (who’s receiving the David O. Selznick Achievement Award) and Jason Blum (who is getting the Milestone Award).

One, it’s after the stock market closes for the weekend. And two, it’s to cause immeasurable fear, rage and chaos in the SNL writers room. They probably had a big State of the Union address thing they were going to do.

FIFA Peace Prize winner and Nobel Peace Prize taker….I launched this attack after me and my Board of Peace decided that we were bored of peace.” He added, “Iran has been two weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon for like, the last 15 years or something. So we had to act now, and we’re doing war. War. What is it good for? Districting from the Epstein files.” The attack on Iran has split some in the MAGA movement, with figures like former Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson condemning it, as Trump ran in 2024 calling for an end to foreign wars. Johnson’s Trump said, “To all my MAGA voters who are upset and saying, ‘This is not what I voted for.’ Well, you did. Don’t you know who I am? I’m me.

Referring to himself humbly as “this lowly middle-aged producer,” Blum said Diller’s “been a friend of mine for a long time and a mentor of mine, and someone I admire so, so much, and he’s changed my life in a lot of ways.” The mega horror producer also thanked his wife Lauren, who “supports me in everything I do”; CAA’s Bryan Lourd, “who believed in before anyone else did”; Universal’s Donna Langley, “who gave Blumhouse a home when we had basically produced a half a movie”; and his “partner” in the newest chapter of his career, “one of the greatest artists I’ve worked with in my life, “James Wan. Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List - Updating Live News PGA's Daryl F. Zanuck Outstanding Producer Nominees Talk Shop Before Awards Show: \"Producing Is Hard, It Is Ghetto\" The crux of Blum’s speech, though, was a story about his parents — and his father, specifically — who while running The Ferus Gallery on La Cienega decades ago, somehow convincing the artist Andy Warhol not only that his iconic 32-piece set of Campbell soup can paintings needed to remain together, but that he should sell them to him for just $2000. Watch on Deadline “That story has stayed with me and it’s in my bones, and it taught me that good taste doesn’t come from consensus. That belief has to come before validation,” Blum told the crowd. “In hindsight, it seems like what my dad did seems easy. But it wasn’t, it was impossible. Everyone was making fun of these paintings. They hung them in their kitchen. And my dad is like, ‘I’m eating tuna fish sandwiches, and I’m going to spend all my money and buy these paintings.” Similarly, Blum said, good producing is “impossible” — and producers, themselves , are impossible. It’s hard to pin down the job of the producer, he suggested, and how they pull off what they do. But he said he believes we can define their craft as the effort “to somehow bring all of us impossible people together. To keep the team intact. To keep the soup cans in tact — even when it would be easier, faster, and more lucrative to sell them off one at a time.” Today, Blum continued, “we’re living in this time where machines are very confident that they can pick what will work, that algorithms can tell us everything we’ve ever watched and what we should watch next, and AI can tell us what to stream and the mood we’re in next Tuesday.” What machines cannot do, however, is “fall in love with something,” or “have instinct.” Said the producer, “If you had asked an algorithm a few months ago to predict how a low-budget gay hockey romance with zero known stars would perform, I promise you the algorithm would’ve been like ‘Do not make that show.’ But that’s why Heated Rivalry needed us; it needed producers.” The show’s key creatives, Jacob Tierney and Brendan Brady, believed in it when perhaps no one else did — and it’s that belief, Blum said, “in artists, in stories, and the road it takes to get things made” that producers as a community do “better than anyone else.” In the past, Blum said, he wasn’t one to tell stories “about people who believed in [someone] before anyone else.” But he’s come to realize that “those stories are really, really important because they tell the next generation that producing matters, that passion matters. That belief matters. That sometimes —oftentimes — the market is wrong.” In winding down, Blum left his audience with the message, “Keep believing in your stories, and in your impossible directors and impossible actors and impossible writers, and most of all, impossible producers, even when we are at our most impossible.” The PGA’s Milestone Award recognizes individuals or teams who have made historic contributions to the entertainment industry. Other contemporary recipients of the prize, once given out to the likes of Louis B. Mayer, Walt Disney and Alfred Hitchcock, include Steven Spielberg, Sherry Lansing, James Cameron, Bob Iger, Donna Langley, Ted Sarandos, George Lucas and Kathleen Kennedy, Charles D. King, and Dana Walden. The founder of Blumhouse, the horror powerhouse that merged with Wan’s Atomic Monster in 2024, Blum’s recent producing credits include Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 , Black Phone 2 , The Lost Bus , and the USA Networks series The Rainmaker , based on the novel by John Grisham. This year’s PGA Awards are taking place at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles. Other honorees include Amy Pascal, who’s receiving the David O. Selznick Achievement Award, and Mara Brock Akil, who’s being recognized with the Norman Lear Achievement Award. ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

Storrie began with the typical opener fare, poking fun at the Crave Canada show’s “spicy” scenes by showcasing a single-second clip of his character, Ilya Rozanov delivering the word “OK,” as the only one cleared to air for promo on broadcast. Related Stories Late Night TV ‘Saturday Night Live’ Opens With Quickly Scripted Sketch Of Trump Exulting In War With Iran: “My Board Of Peace Decided We Were Bored Of Peace” Late Night TV ‘Heated Rivalry’ Star Hudson Williams Skates Onto Connor Storrie’s ‘SNL’ Debut In Cameo In an extended bit, an earnest Storrie then pivoted to a trio of dramatic asides, in which he played up being a self-serious ac tor . But upon delving into the difficulties of his HR role — learning Russian and how to play hockey — he was interrupted by brothers Quinn Hughes and Jack Hughes , who were part of the men’s hockey team that won Olympic gold in Milan. Quinn Hughes assured Storrie he was “great” at playing hockey on screen, while Jack Hughes said, “I got my teeth knocked out in the final, does that happen in your show?” Watch on Deadline “Metaphorically,” Storrie replied cheekily, wagging his eyebrows at the Studio 8H audience. But the applause the Hughes siblings got paled in comparison to the extended cheers received by Team USA women’s hockey champions Hilary Knight and Megan Keller , who also clinched Olympic gold. “Don’t worry, we saw your show,” Keller told Storrie, after the Hughes brothers admitted they hadn’t watched Heated Rivalry yet. It was a not-so-subtle truce to end the kerfuffle spurred by a locker room video that featured the men’s team, post-win, laughing along with President Donald Trump when he joked he had to reluctantly also invite the women’s team to the White House. “It was gonna be just us, but we thought we’d invite the guys too,” Knight said knowingly. Meanwhile, Quinn Hughes admitted that the last time the men won gold was 46 years ago, while the women did so two “whole Olympics ago.” Watch the monologue above. Admittedly, it’s frustrating that Storrie’s debut was overshadowed by the Hugheses having to awkwardly deliver redress for their team’s misogyny. Earlier this week, the two had appeared on Good Morning America and tepidly addressed the video, as well as the men’s team’s decision to visit with Trump in the Oval Office. (The women’s team declined the invitation .) “I’m glad you mentioned the women’s team again. We’re extremely happy for them. Obviously, a lot going on with social media right now surrounding our team and their team,” Quinn Hughes said in part. Meanwhile, Jack Hughes said during a press conference later : “It is what it is now, like, we have so much respect for the women’s team, they have so much respect for us, and we’re all just proud Americans. We’re happy that we both swept the Olympics.” Knight told GMA Thursday , “I thought the call in itself was distasteful and an awesome learning moment to refocus the narrative and understand our words matter, and how we speak about women matters, and we need to celebrate this team.” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

In a rare Hollywood appearance, specifically onstage, the former Paramount CEO, Fox CEO and current Who Knew author took digs at Jack Warner, David Ellison , Harvey Weinstein as well as the guy he was presenting the PGA Milestone Award to, his amigo, Jason Blum . Diller began, “Samuel Goldwyn, Adolph Zukor, Jack Warner — what would Jack Warner do if he knew he was being succeeded by a stunt pilot?” That latter dig being directed at Paramount CEO, David Ellison, who recently won the bid for Warner Bros. Related Stories News Jason Blum Rallies Producers to Keep Believing In The \"Impossible\" As He Accepts PGA Milestone Award News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List: 'KPop Demon Hunters' Takes Animated Category - Updating Live Diller went on, “Cecil B. Demille and now Jason Blum.” Watch on Deadline The Chairman and Senior executive of IAC and Expedia Group reminded the Fairmont Century Plaza ballroom full of producers “you also gave this award to Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves, so there it is. There is commonality with the greats.” “DeMille made movies for $15,000, and so did Blum almost 100 years later. To say he’s cheap isn’t a characterization, it’s a defining attribute,” continued Diller. “Take his approach to air travel, where instead of buying a first-class ticket for an overnight flight, Jason would buy three cheap seats, all together, bring an actual inflatable mattress on board the plane, and then horrify fellow passengers with the loud motor of his electric pump. But he’s serene in all this, as in all of his other cheap eccentricities. Jason’s an intermittent faster, in that he only eats food if the food is free, and as my wife once observed, when Jason’s on our boat, he behaves like a tourist at an all-inclusive resort.” “I’m giving this award to Jason not because I like horror movies, I actually hate them, but because we’ve been friends since before he matriculated, if that’s the right word to describe working for Harvey Weinstein. How he found his groove after that is anyone’s guess, but he sure did find it. 300 films — made on the lowest pay scales in film history — but he also did something quite extraordinary in itself, and that’s helping artists tell stories and helping them make a lot of money. Along the way, and rarely, did the two go hand in hand,” exclaimed Diller. Diller praised Blum for staying focused on his mission for low budget fare with high profit margins versus projects promising awards campaigns or tentpole franchises possibilities. “The shiny objects in this town are endless. Jason, though, stayed focused on scary and people betting on themselves,” said Diller. In summing up Blum, Diller (who recently came out in his memoir) further ribbed the horror producer as a guy who’s “married with children, lots of them, and hoping that they don’t emulate his favorite pleasures like dressing in drag, wearing diamond jewelry, and riding a unicycle.” “But Jason is this odd something of a Renaissance man. A true embodiment of, ‘A man can do all things if he will.’ And it is his will and his stick-to perseverance of what he believes in and how essentially honest and honorable has been that which makes me ever so glad to be able to present this award to him.” Taking the stage, Blum exclaimed, “I think my biggest achievement is getting Barry Diller to the PGAs!” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

Slowikowska and Brennan were in the foreground trying to tamp down a smile amid the applause. Watch on Deadline Throughout the sketch, Slowikowska attempts to redirect her would-be-fiance’s attention to their romantic disintegration, as he becomes increasingly distracted by the skaters’ unabated whimsy and random lore. “I’ve never felt so cool,” Williams says as he forms a conga line with the fellas. In response, Brennan balks at the idea — surely, Williams has experienced cooler things? “How is that possible,” he questions. “I don’t know, it’s just how I feel,” Slowikowska’s Candace says. “No, sorry, I meant, like, how is ice skating in a four-person train the coolest that that guy has ever felt?” At another point, Storrie’s character is revealed to be Kendrick Lamar’s producer, and Brennan once again interrupts Slowikowska to express disbelief that the guy has any connection to the Grammy-winning rapper. As Slowikowska struggles to once again pivot the conversation to their dying relationship and diverging life paths, Brennan is shown on the ice, dismissively saying, “OK, sounds good.

Selznick Award at the PGAs tonight. That sarcastic The PGA’s David O. Selznick Award recognizes a producer or producing team for their extraordinary body of work in motion pictures. Tonight Pascal joined a distinguished line of recipients that includes Steven Spielberg, Barbara Broccoli, Billy Wilder, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, Mary Parent, Tom Cruise, Martin Scorsese and last year’s Chris Meledandri. Related Stories News 'One Battle After Another' Wins Top PGA Award: Full List News Barry Diller Jokes About Jack Warner Being \"Succeeded By A Stunt Pilot\" As He Takes On Paramount WBD Merger At PGA Awards The producer of the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies , Spiderverse animated trilogy and the upcoming Amazon MGM Studios’ Project Hail Mary laid out a list of axioms for being a producer. Watch on Deadline “All my life people have said relationships are bad for business, I really struggle with that,” she said paying thanks to every she worked with including, but not limited to “the Columbia Lady”, Sony Motion Pictures Chairman Tom Rothman, Netflix’s Ted Sarandos and Bela Bajaria, Amazon MGM Studios’ Mike Hopkins, Sue Kroll and Courtenay Valenti as well as PGA co-Presidents Donald DeLine (Pascal met him at UCLA and they “leapfrogged across West Hollywood from apartment to apartment) and Stephanie Allain (“allowed me to tag along with her to Aunt Kizzy’s back porch where I watched as she persuaded John Singleton to make Boyz in the Hood with us). She also gave thanks to her husband Bernie Weintraub, son Anthony, sister Jenny and producing partner Rachel O’Connor (“who when Sony got hacked, begged me to take her to wherever I was going”). “How can it be possible that relationships are not at the heart of it all?” exclaimed Pascal. “When I first became a producer sitting in the office I stole back from Seth and Evan, recently fumigated to get rid of the weed smell, I was wondering why directors and actors and writers no longer agreed with everything I said. Well duh. I was no longer holding that metaphorical green light gun in my hand.” Beamed the current producer of the 007 movies, “Receiving the David O. Selznick Award from my peers and by my peers, I mean all of you in this room have the audacity to make things happen, well that is really something. But let’s be honest, the only thing the legendary David O. Selznick and I have in common is that we both write a lot of notes and both love uppers which probably explains all the notes.” “Being a producer is sitting in the editing room with Chris and Phil having stayed up all night long, watching every cut of our movie, certain I have the most brilliant idea then politely listening and then doing something totally different and thanking God they did.” “Being a producer is trying to do jedi mind tricks out of a port-a-potty wearing pairs of hand warmers.” “Being a producer is sitting in a meeting hearing the germ of an idea and having the patience not to kill it before it even exists.” “Being a producer is having the self-confidence or at least pretending that you do so that when Kevin (Feige) says I think I can help you, you let him.” “Being a producer is falling in love with a book, the author choosing Plan B or Luckychap or David Heyman instead of you.” “Being a producer is the shocking realization that you’re not gonna be good at everything and that some people are just better than you. You better figure out what you are honestly obsessed with and fight like hell to make it happen.” “Being a producer is knowing that there is no such thing as a great movie without a great director.” “And being a producer is knowing that no matter how bad things get, how many mistakes you make, and how many failures you have, it’s never really over no matter what anyone tells you.” The honor was presented to Pascal by 4x Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig, the former having produced the latter’s Oscar winning Little Women and upcoming Netflix mega film, Narnia. Gerwig spoke about pitching Pascal to allow the actress to direct Little Women. Gerwig was bowled over by how Pascal took a chance on her. Gerwig quipped that Pascal tonight is “honored, excited, and she wants to leave because she wants to go back to work.” Gerwig says Pascal gave her note about her presentation speech tonight, to specify that not all the films in her reel she produced. Some she greenlit (i.e. Superbad, This is the End , Men in Black ) and greenlighting and producing are not the same thing. Said Pascal at the top of her acceptance speech, “I knew how important Greta was gonna be to me when I told her my favorite book was the Little Fur Family and she said ‘Oh, my God! My favorite part of that book is the page where the little bear watches a tinier bear disappear down a hole and I gasped and said ‘Me too!'” ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

In the high-wire, PSA-style skit titled ‘Tourette’s,’ a host of celebrities, including J.K. Rowling, Mel Gibson, The Real Housewives of New York star Jill Zarin , Armie Hammer , Louis C.K., Bill Cosby and Ye claim they suffer from Tourette’s, which would explain problematic comments or actions they have been involved in.

Harkening back to the BAFTA controversy, SNL ‘s mock Tourette’s PSA was “brought to you by National Workforce of Rethinking Disabilities, or N.W.O.R.D.” At last weekend’s BAFTA ceremony, Davidson shouted the N-word at presenters Delroy Lindo and Michael B. Jordan, along with other offensive language earlier at the event. The ceremony’s host Alan Cumming apologized for the “strong language,” noting that it was a result of “involuntary verbal tics.” The racial slur made it to the BBC’s tape-delayed BAFTA telecast. ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Heated Rivalry’ Stars Reunite; Gold Medal U.S. Hockey Teams; Trump-Iran Cold Open ‘Frankenstein’, ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop’ Take Top Film Prizes: Full List Best Looks At The NAACP Image Awards & Brit Awards Read More About: Comments"

The tune, which Warren wrote for and is featured in Bess Kargman ’s documentary Diane Warren: Relentless , extends the songwriter’s undesirable records for most noms in that Oscar category without a win and most noms for a woman in any Oscar category without a win. (Warren did receive an honorary statuette from the Academy in 2022, but it’s just not the same thing!) It’s also her ninth consecutive nom in the category, and eleventh nom in 12 years. Related Stories News Ghislaine Maxwell or Diane Warren? The Internet Can't Decide Hollywoof! Diane Warren: Cat Crusader Given that Warren is a perennial bridesmaid, one might assume that the 69-year-old Van Nuys native is disliked by her peers, but the exact opposite, in fact, is true. She’s actually one of the most popular people in town, especially amongst her peers in the Academy’s music branch, who solely determine the best original song Oscar nominees. And you don’t rack up 17 noms because people don’t like you or your work. Rather, the issue seems to be that in years when Warren has been nominated for an absolute banger (like, say, “How Do I Live,” from Con Air ), she has had the misfortune of coming up against another one that is somehow even bigger (like, in that year, “My Heart Will Go On,” from Titanic ). And when she has been nominated on other occasions (like, say, the year that she and Lady Gaga were co-nominated for “Til It Happens to You,” from the documentary The Hunting Ground ), she has had the misfortune of coming up against songs from films that were much more widely seen by the full Academy (in that case, “Glory,” from Selma ), which determines the best original song winner. One never knows when the Oscar gods might smile upon Warren, so she assures THR that, as always, she will be at this year’s ceremony — where “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters is expected to win best original song — with hope in her heart and a speech in her pocket. In the meantime, this musical walk down memory lane — which Warren recorded at RealSongs, her music publishing company’s headquarters in Hollywood — offers a powerful reminder of just how great — and unlucky — she has been for so long!

According to Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office records, LaBeouf was taken into custody Saturday and charged with one additional misdemeanor count of simple battery. The Transformers star’s attorney, Sarah Chervinsky, said that after learning New Orleans police had issued a new arrest warrant Friday, LaBeouf voluntarily turned himself in to the Orleans Parish jail, according to the Associated Press . “No regular person would be required to post over $100,000 in bonds and be jailed two separate times for one misdemeanor incident,” Chervinsky said. “Just as he does not deserve preferential treatment, Mr. LaBeouf also does not deserve to be treated more harshly by the police and courts just because he is a public figure.” Related Stories General News Who Won and Lost the Week: The Great Netflix Pull-Out Edition (Plus Tyra, Shia and More) News Shia LaBeouf to Remain Free on $100,000 Bail After New Orleans Bar Altercation The legal trouble began during Mardi Gras earlier this month.

Authorities said he became aggressive and allegedly fought with two men, both of whom told police he assaulted them. LaBeouf is accused of punching one bartender multiple times and striking another in the face. He also allegedly shouted homophobic slurs during the incident. The Hollywood Reporter reported details of the altercation at the time. LaBeouf was later taken to a local hospital for undisclosed injuries. After being released, he was formally charged with two counts of simple battery. In an interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan released Saturday morning, the 39-year-old actor addressed what he said led to his initial arrest and discussed his recent behavior. “It’s not nice to hurt people ever. It’s fucking lame. People got hurt. I got to deal with that. I’mma deal with that in full. I’ll eat it all,” he said. “It was on me. It’s not on them. It’s on me. I messed up.” When asked if he takes responsibility, LaBeouf responded, “Definitely. Yeah. 1,000 percent.” He added, “My side is this — my behavior, bullshit. I got to deal with that. Does that mean I got to go to rehab again? I’m just not into it, bro. I don’t think my answers are there. If I genuinely did, I’d go. I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I think I have a different problem, and I’m going to address it.” The Fury actor said he believes he has a “small man complex,” explaining, “I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more so than my drinking. That’s where I’m at now on my journey, and I’m trying to navigate it.” When asked what triggered his anger, LaBeouf said, “I’ll be honest with you, big gay people are scary to me. I’m standing by myself, and three gay dudes are next to me, touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry if that’s homophobic. Then I’m that.” Asked whether that situation happens often, he said it occurred only once. “That’s why I got arrested,” he said. LaBeouf concluded, “I am wrong for touching anyone, ever.

Deon Cole is hosting the ceremony airing live on BET and CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where winners will be announced in various categories spanning film and TV. Saturday’s awards took place just hours after the U.S. and Israel launched strikes on Iran, with President Donald Trump saying that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in the attacks. While Cole didn’t mention the Iran attacks in his monologue, he still offered timely commentary on Trump, ICE and Trump supporter Nicki Minaj. Related Stories Movies Leonardo DiCaprio to Miss Actor Awards Due to Filming Martin Scorsese's 'What Happens at Night' TV How to Watch the 2026 NAACP Image Awards Online As Cole took the stage, he called the event the “Trump image awards,” joking, “we had to do that.” He continued of the president, who has added his name to the Kennedy Center and reportedly wants it added to other facilities like Washington’s Dulles International Airport and New York’s Penn Station, “He wants his name on everything. If we didn’t do that, we’d go to commercial and come back to a rerun of Matlock .” As for ICE, Cole asked for permission to curse and, in remarks that were bleeped for the television audience but were greeted with a great deal of applause in the room, appeared to say, “Fuck ICE.” “I don’t want to see no ICE ever again,” he said, joking that he took guests like Ice Cube and Ice Spice off the guest list and couldn’t watch the Winter Olympics because there was too much ice. Cole even offered the first of multiple allusions early in the show to last Sunday’s BAFTA Awards controversy involving guest John Davidson , who has Tourette Syndrome , and could be heard shouting the N-word while Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were onstage presenting an award. The incident reached a wider audience when it aired during the BBC broadcast of the awards show. BAFTA has since offered a full apology for the incident and vowed to launch a “comprehensive review” of the ceremony. During a segment about humorous prayers that he offered for Teyana Taylor, 50 Cent and Minaj (who Cole said has been “going through a lot lately and hasn’t been herself”), Cole offered a prayer for anyone in the audience with Tourette’s to “read the room.” Later, presenting the first award of the evening, to Sinners ‘ Miles Caton, Regina Hall took a moment to recognize “kings” Jordan and Lindo for their “class,” comments that led to a standing ovation. Abbott Elementary star and creator Quinta Brunson, winning the second award of the evening for best actress in a comedy series, also offered a shoutout to the cast and crew of Sinners . “We see you,” she said. “We’re behind you … love you.” Special honorees recognized Saturday night include Chairman’s Award recipient Viola Davis and President’s Award recipient Colman Domingo. Additionally, Salt-n-Pepa and DJ Spinderella were inducted into the NAACP Image Awards ’ Hall of Fame. The ceremony also paid tribute to the late Rev. Jesse Jackson, with NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson honoring the late civil rights activist, whose family was in attendance at the ceremony. “He worked to open the eyes of those who could not see and give hope to those without it,” Johnson said. Samuel L. Jackson spoke about how the leader who shared his last name “inspired” him and others who have spoken out and protested. “Even though we can no longer hear his voice, when we see a wrong we can ask ourselves, ‘What would Jesse do?'” Jesse Jackson, Samuel L. Jackson said, made him realize “I am somebody,” referencing one of Jesse Jackson’s most famous quotes. After the audience joined him on “somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson led the crowd in the affirmation. “Reverend Jackson, because of you, we are somebody,” Samuel L. Jackson added. “Power to the people!” Numerous winners were already revealed in non-televised ceremonies earlier this week, including virtual ceremonies on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. In the virtual ceremonies, Michelle Obama, Will Packer and Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show were among the winners on night one . Lamar, SZA and Cardi B were among the night two winners . And Sinners, Gracie’s Corner, Ironheart, Celebrity Family Feud and Straw were among the multiple award winners on night three . Additional winners were revealed at the NAACP Image Awards Creative Honors , where Sinners , which leads this year’s NAACP Image Awards nominees with 18 nods, racked up four wins, in addition to the three trophies it received during the virtual ceremonies. Even more winners were revealed Friday, during the NAACP Image Awards’ Reception & Fashion Show, where A$AP Rocky was honored with the Vanguard Award for Fashion. There, Sinners ‘ Ruth E. Carter won best costume design . Other Friday awards included best hairstyling for TV or film , which went to Reasonable Doubt ; best makeup for TV or film , which went to Bel-Air ; and best digital content creator – fashion/beauty, which went to Wisdom Kaye.

Lachlan Bailey/Tommy Hilfiger Husband and wife duo Patrick Schwarzenegger and Abby Champion are starring in a new Tommy Hilfiger campaign. The brand announced its Spring 2026 campaign last week, featuring Schwarzenegger, Champion and a slew of familiar faces including Tommy and Dee Hilfiger, Lionel Richie, Iman, MGK, Checo Pérez, Lucien Laviscount, Soo Joo Park, Luke Champion and Raphael Diogo. “What makes Tommy unique is that his world genuinely sits at the intersection of fashion and entertainment,” Schwarzenegger exclusively told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement. “Being part of this campaign with Abby felt less like a traditional shoot and more like stepping into something real that he’s built over decades.” Related Stories Movies Haley Lu Richardson on 'Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die' Twist and Urging Sam Rockwell to Check Into 'The White Lotus' TV 'The White Lotus' Season 4 Casts Helena Bonham Carter, Marissa Long and Chris Messina The White Lotus star added, “That authenticity is what make this brand so special. I’m so excited to continue our relationship and to work with Tommy once again.” Patrick Schwarzenegger. Lachlan Bailey The campaign, which was shot by Lachlan Bailey, serves as an “invitation” to Hilfiger’s “world of ease, warmth and entertainment,” and is inspired by “four decades of blending fashion with art, music, entertainment and sport,” according to a release from the brand. The Spring 2026 campaign is the first in a series of inspired by Hilfiger’s favorite destinations around the world. This particular aesthetic takes inspiration from Hilfiger’s Palm Beach home. Schwarzenegger and Champion are photographed against classic Cadillacs and pool side loungers. In a release for the campaign, Hilfiger describes building the brand with “endless curiosity, a belief in dreaming big and a love of bringing people together” over the last 40 years. “From the beginning, I looked to the creative voices shaping pop culture to help guide that vision,” he said. “This season, we’ve invited a cross-generation cast of icons and contemporary voices to the ultimate Spring party — to share in the way I live,” Hilfiger continued. “It’s a celebration alive with personality and modern American style.” Abby Champion for Tommy Hilfiger. Lachlan Bailey Schwarzenegger described Hilfiger as “the ultimate host,” noting his knack for curating an exciting group of people. “There’s something about the way he brings people together,” Champion added in a release. “You never know who’s going to arrive or what the night will turn into. One minute you’re chatting with Iman, the next Lionel Richie is behind the decks.” The Spring 2026 collection, unlike the Palm Beach-inspired campaign, is inspired by Hilfiger’s love for West Coast style, particularly California’s unique brand of prep looks.

Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET Viola Davis delivered a powerful speech at the 2026 NAACP Image Awards on Saturday night, where she reflected on her early beginnings, success in the industry and the current state of the nation. The EGOT winner was honored with the Chairman’s Award, hitting the stage on Saturday and beginning her acceptance speech by noting, “I always feel like I’m going to step into feeling like I deserve it.” “I like this quote, that the definition of hell is on your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person that you could have become,” she continued. “I say that about our nation, I say that about myself; that there is no becoming until you face the depth and the darkness of your own soul. There is no becoming without healing, and without a radical acceptance of one’s truth. I know that about myself growing up in poverty.” Related Stories Movies 2026 NAACP Image Awards: Winners List (Updating Live) Movies Leonardo DiCaprio to Miss Actor Awards Due to Filming Martin Scorsese's 'What Happens at Night' The Woman King actress reflected on her upbringing, noting, “Little chocolate girl with thick lips and wide nose in Rhode Island in 1965. I didn’t see hope. I didn’t see dreams. I just wanted to be somebody. I wanted success because I thought it was significance. And no one can describe the journey of going from the little chocolate girl searching for hope, searching for God, and the girl living a transcendent life.” “That is a hero’s journey, and we have only to follow the thread of a hero’s path. And where we had thought we would find an abomination, we shall find a God. And where we thought that we could slay the other, we will slay ourselves. And where we had thought to journey outwards, we shall come to the center of our own existence,” Davis added. “And where we had thought to be alone, we shall come to be with all the world. There is no soul of a nation without the soul of its people. And the soul of its people is not just who is represented in the breathing and alive people in this room, but by all those who are no longer here. We either move forward together or not at all. There is no man behind the curtain who has a control over your life.” “Our crown has already been bought and paid for,” she said. “All we have to do is wear it.” Davis went on to commend “the people that we forget, the people don’t that we don’t think about, the work that we don’t want to do,” sharing praise for “the people working at the food pantry in Central Falls feeding 3000 people a month, the people who are caring for my mother who’s in advanced dementia, caring for the least of these.” “You are my hero. I see you,” she concluded. “Thank you.” Saturday night, Colman Domingo additionally received the President’s Award, while Salt-n-Pepa and DJ Spinderella were set to be inducted into the NAACP Image Awards ’ Hall of Fame.

Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET At the end of the week that saw the 2026 BAFTA Awards descend into controversy after guest John Davidson, who has Tourette Syndrome, shouted the N-word while Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented an award, the 2026 NAACP Image Awards offered numerous opportunities for those affected by the incident to express their support for Jordan and Lindo.

Earlier during Saturday’s NAACP Image Awards, which aired live on CBS and BET, host Deon Cole jokingly offered a prayer for anyone in the audience with Tourette’s to “read the room.” Later, presenting the first award of the evening, to Sinners ‘ Miles Caton, Regina Hall took a moment to recognize “kings” Jordan and Lindo for their “class,” comments that led to a standing ovation. Abbott Elementary star and creator Quinta Brunson, winning the second award of the evening for best actress in a comedy series, also offered a shoutout to the cast and crew of Sinners . “We see you,” she said. “We’re behind you … love you.” Sinners led this year’s NAACP Image Awards nominations with 18 nods and had won nine of those by the time Coogler and Lindo took the stage. Afterward, the film won two more, including best actor (Michael B. Jordan) and best motion picture, bringing its total to 11. THR"

The singer-songwriter, who was nominated for international artist and international song, was at the end of his smash single “Undressed” when a man joined him on the podium and shoved him hard. Security guards aggressively removed the man from the stage, and Sombr returned to the microphone to segue into his next song.

Fans were already split online over whether the incident was staged or real. Naysayers noticed that the offender was wearing a shirt that read “Sombr is a homewrecker” — a nod to his latest single “Homewrecker,” which some claimed was a dead giveaway. But others weren’t necessarily convinced it was a stunt, considering how hard he was pushed and how additional security guards came to his rescue. Popular on Variety Brits host Jack Whitehall remarked on the incident after Sombr’s performance concluded. “Such a shame we didn’t have the security ready,” he said. The incident took place just days after Britain’s BAFTA Awards last Sunday, when John Davidson, the Scottish Tourette’s syndrome activist and real-life inspiration for the film “I Swear,” disrupted that ceremony with an outburst of racial slurs that occurred as “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were onstage. “I can’t begin to explain how upset and distraught I have been as the impact from Sunday sinks in,” Davidson told Variety earlier this week. Whitehall made a joking reference to that incident — which was not bleeped from the initial BAFTA broadcast and was audible to viewers — at the top of the Brits, saying “We’ve got the best in the business on the bleep button.” Sombr is coming off a red-hot year that saw his various singles “Undressed,” “Back to Friends” and “12 to 12” impact the charts. He recently performed at the Grammy Awards, where he was nominated for best new artist alongside Addison Rae, Alex Warren, the Marías, Leon Thomas, Lola Young, Katseye and Olivia Dean, who ended up taking home the award.

Discovery Deal 1 day ago See All Penguin Random House Hello Crawlers: The “ Dungeon Crawler Carl ” TV series announced in August 2024 is alive and well at NBCUniversal and Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions, according to author Matt Dinniman , who has already read the first few scripts for the project. “Right now, we’re at the point where Chris Yost, who’s writing the show, has written a few episodes,” Dinniman told Variety in an interview Friday. “And I don’t think it’s public yet, the streaming service that has picked it up, but we’re getting pretty close to the point where a decision needs to be made, like contracts needs to be made, whether or not they’re going to go ahead and go with. And that whole process involves the scripts, involves CGI testing, and budgetary stuff, and lots of stuff that’s above my pay grade.” Related Stories KLOS-FM Radio Host Uncle Joe Benson Dies at 76 Dinniman continued: “So the project, as of this moment, is still very much alive. We’re still very much moving forward. Things are happening literally daily. But I’ve also had friends who’ve gone through this process and everything hits a brick wall. And I’ve seen it happen so many times, I’m just kind of in a, ‘Well, I’ll believe it when I see it’ state. But this is where we’re headed right now, and I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll get there.” Popular on Variety Back in 2023, Dinniman says someone reached out to him asking if the movie and TV rights were available. He spoke with an entertainment attorney who had read “Carl” and was already a fan, and the lawyer advised him that this was a legitimate offer — “but it’s not the one we went with,” Dinniman said. “He said, you need an agent. And through him, I found both my literary agent, and then my film and TV rights agents at WME. And they created a pitch and they approached multiple studios, and we had multiple people looking at it.” Dinniman says his “specific criteria” for the project was he’d “only work with someone who’s read it and enjoyed it and doesn’t want to just snatch up.” And he found that in NBCUniversal subsequently Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door, which has an overall deal with the studio. Since the series was announced, “Carl” fans have been debating whether the live-action format is the right move here. Dinniman understands the concern, but he makes the case for why he’s willing to give it a shot over animation (though MacFarlane is certainly no stranger to an animated show). “It’s kind of funny. A lot of the more hardcore nerdy fans — I mean, like I am — will say, we want it animated. And then I think actually the majority of people who aren’t into animation are going to say, we want a live action,” Dinniman said. “If you actually poll people out on the street, it’s going to be a pretty high number of live action. But that’s really high risk, high reward, because we’re not going to do it if it’s gonna look like absolute shit. And they will do CGI testing on Princess Donut and stuff like that. And that’s all I can say, I think. It’s all gonna hinge on what it looks like. But Fuzzy Door, specifically, if you watch ‘Ted’ or ‘The Orville, ‘you’ll see that they know what they’re doing when it comes to this. So I would say, don’t knock it till you try it.” Dinniman believes the potential show, which still needs to be ordered to series at a streamer or platform, is in good hands, but also says he has not revealed the planned ending of the final “Carl” book to that producing team — or to anyone else. So if, God forbid, something happens to him before he finishes the series… “Nope. That is your problem,” Dinniman said, adding: “Maybe you could get Brandon Sanderson to write it?” Dinniman says his latest release, “ Operation Bounce House ,” is an idea that’s been with him since high school, well before he conceived “Carl” around 2007. He then wrote the “vast majority” of “Bounce House” at the end of 2024 with current events being “what pretty much shaped the story it became.” Read more from Variety ‘s interview with Dinniman below, including spoilers breaking down the ending of his newly released book, “Operation Bounce House,” and teases for the upcoming eighth book in the “Dungeon Crawler Carl” series, “Parade of Horribles,” set to release May 12. “Dungeon Crawler Carl” has been dealing with the topic of genocide from the very beginning. But “Operation Bounce House” also delves into genocide. Was that because there was a specific story that you wanted to tell in “Carl” that you couldn’t there, or a different message you feel like you’re sending with “Operation Bounce House”? I think “Operation Bounce House” gets closer to today than “Carl.” “Carl” is kind of esoteric in how we deal with like othering and people who don’t view people as the same as them. But it’s also aliens versus humans, whereas this is humans versus humans. In “Operation Bounce House,” it’s very specifically related to our online behavior; how we have this computer between us, and that’s all we know about the other people. When we have this great filter that’s the government saying, “This is who they are. This is what they’ve done. This is what they’re doing to you. So this is what we should do to them.” And yes, they are similar stories, but “Operation Bounce House” is definitely a little more honest and relevant to things that are happening in the world today. How did you reach the point in “Operation Bounce House” where they give up on showing the people of Earth the horrible things that are happening on New Sonora, and instead perform their show and stream the documentary about their everyday lives? Were there any specific moments in 2024 that inspired that, and what it actually takes for people to care about what’s happening to others? When I started writing and I was like, what can they do? Do we do just another regular, big fight and then they beat them at the end? No, what happens is, they decide that instead of showing them all the horrible things they’ve done — because what happens is people see something horrible, and then they look away. But when they see something that they can relate with like, humans just being humans, then they finally relate. And it ends up it’s the pig’s and the chickens’ Instagram account that pretty much helps them along the way. And there wasn’t one specific event that happened. It’s been one thing after another; it’s happening everywhere you look. And I didn’t want it to be laser focused on one specific event anyway. But everywhere you look, it’s people who are clustered in their — I don’t want to say the word tribes, but that’s what I say in the book. It seems like this Group A doesn’t like Group B, and because of that, even though A is way stronger than Group B, they’re beating them down. And there’s echo chambers that are just reinforcing that and reinforcing that. But I’ve found strongly that when you meet someone face to face, you hang out with them, and you become friends with them, your world view changes greatly. And I don’t want to make any definitive conclusions based on that, but I’ve found people who live in settings where they have more friendly interaction with people who are different than themselves, they tend to be significantly more open minded about other people. The problem is, when you start grouping so many people together and it’s like an urban setting, then some people start to feel isolated again. So I don’t know what the solution is. I think Roger and his fellow AIs in the book had their solution, and I don’t think that’s the solution myself. Speaking of Roger Roger and the AI in “Operation Bounce House,” it’s very different than the AI we’ve gotten to know over a long time and several books in “Dungeon Crawler Carl.” What are the different things you are trying to say about AI in these stories? So first off, the AI in “Carl” is a different sort of thing. It’s not the same sort of AI that’s affecting our lives today. That’s going to be abundantly clear in Book 8, it’s a completely different thing. But that was one of the reasons why I wanted to write “Operation Bounce House,” because “Carl” started people asking me constantly, well, what’s your opinion on AI? And I think it’s pretty abundantly clear with my book “Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon,” which I wrote in 2018, that was about an artist who lost his job because of AI art. And that was before that really started to happen. And then Roger Roger, the generative AI has become more intelligent. And then they started working autonomously. And in the story of New Sonora, we make it so digital masking or filters or pretending to be someone else becomes illegal. And that’s impossible, obviously, with the way the internet currently works. So they have to tear the whole internet down and rebuild it, basically, to stop that from happening. And I don’t see us tearing down the internet to fix it, but I see this becoming a very, very huge issue. Forget the environmental stuff, which is important as well; forget the fact that AI is trained using illicitly gained materials; forget that for a moment and just focus on what’s actually going to happen. Today, a lot of people talk about how AI art sucks, it looks stupid, it’s fake. But that’s not going to keep happening. And that’s not true, first off. AI art is good and that’s gonna be a problem because it’s getting better. Mark Lawrence, who is an author, he has a blog that he wrote in August of 2025 , not very long ago. And you can look at it right now, there’s eight short stories up there. Four of them are written by famous authors, four of them are written by AI, and they’re all mixed up. You don’t know who’s who, and you’re supposed to vote and guess. And if you look at the results, they’re absolutely terrifying. These are really short stories, like 100-word stories, but that’s where AI is going. So the question has to change to, assuming AI is just as good or better than humans at some things, then should we still be afraid of it? And I think the answer is yes. First off, the whole purpose of art is to celebrate another human’s vision. The whole purpose of looking at a painting is to see through someone else’s eyes for a moment. And when you remove the human element, what’s the point? I mean, corporations aren’t gonna give a shit because they want a picture of a chair on their website, and they don’t want to pay someone $50 to draw a picture of a chair, so they’re just gonna go to AI. So this argument is never gonna solve anything, but that’s my argument. We are slowly, slowly, slowly squeezing the humanity out of the one thing that humanity shines best at, and that is our creative, our artwork. And because of that, we are slowly, slowly, slowly going to where the dark vision I envision in “Operation Bounce House,” where we are cruel to each other. And that’s the event horizon I see we’re about to step into with AI. What can we do about it? I have no fucking clue. But that’s where we’re headed, I think. You mentioned Book 8, “Parade of Horribles.” It looks like the length of this one is going to be about 700 pages. That would be the shortest book since Book 5, “Butcher’s Masquerade.” So “Butcher’s Masquerade,” I think, is 220,000 words. And this one is right on 200,000 words. It’s longer than “Gate of the Feral Gods,” or it’s about the same length, and it’s way shorter than “This Inevitable Ruin,” and shorter than “Eye of the Bedlam Bride.” What should we make of that? Well, first, it’s a non-Scolapendra floor. So there’s less — I don’t want to say less story tickering, because something very major happens at the end of it. But it was always going to be a little bit shorter, I think. In addition, Penguin Random House deliberately told me, we want this to be shorter. And I was like, that’s going to be fine — but the next one is going to be really long. So what we’re going to do, I think, is — this isn’t set in stone — but I think 9 is the last book, but it’ll be split into two books. So there’s still going to be 10 books total, but I anticipate the last one is going to be pretty wordy. I’m a pretty wordy dude. The first draft [of “Parade of Horribles”] was 235,000 words, which puts it slightly longer than “Butcher’s Masquerade,” but the final version I turned in was like 195,000 and it grew to be about 200,000. That’s still really long! The average book is 70,000 words. I’d love to know how your writing process has changed since the very beginning. The way you are writing “Carl” now vs. the way you were writing and distributing “Carl” before, knowing that in May, the number of eyes that will be on “Parade of Horribles” is so much higher. Well, it’s pretty insane. By the time I was done with Book 3, “The Dungeon Anarchist’s Cookbook,” I had maybe 500 people, 1,000 people reading it. And now, I will literally have over a million people read “Dungeon Crawler Carl” Book 8. And that’s a lot of pressure. You see other authors who may not finish their books, without naming names, and I get it. I do get it. Because what happens is, you go to these events and these signings, and people come up to you and they say, “This book has changed my life. This book, I can’t stop thinking about it, it’s everything to me.” I have people tell me that they’ve been suicidal, and they’re putting off killing themselves because they’re waiting for my book. And that’s a lot of pressure — that’s weight on my own mental health. And I can understand other authors just crushing under that weight. And for me personally, I can’t wait to sit down and write. I can’t wait to get these words out. So it affects me greatly, but it doesn’t affect my output, if that makes sense. But I worry so much about what other people think, to a certain extent, but it doesn’t stop me from doing stupid shit when I’m writing. Like, the stupidest thing you’d ever think of ends up happening at the end of Book 8, I can’t wait for people to read it. But the process is so different. I was doing everything myself, from the editing, or hiring editors and doing a lot of it just myself. And now with Book 8, I still self-publish “Dungeon Crawler Carl” and Penguin Random House licenses the right to publish the physical copies. But it is going through their editorial process now. So I have someone that I don’t know, I haven’t talked to face to face, being the one that’s sending me edits on commas and all that stuff. And that’s very different. There’s the marketing people that are setting up things like this, sending me on tour. And a lot of these people are people I’ve not necessarily met. There’s this whole engine. I was just at the Penguin Random House building, and it’s like this huge building with hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of people working there, and all of that to create all the books that they publish. Whereas in self publishing you’re so close to it, and you’re sitting there and you see the stats/ I know up to the minute how many books are being sold. And in this, you don’t get those sort of stats. So it’s so different, in so many different ways. The audience is different. In August of 2024, when the hardcover Book 1 came out, suddenly people were walking into stores and buying it and then posting about it on TikTok. My demographics went from maybe 90% male to now 40% male readers. So many more women readers are reading it and then they’re convincing their husbands and boyfriends, who don’t read, to read it. And that’s just caused an explosion in sales. We went from maybe 500,000 total sales to about 7 million at this point. And it’s just crazy. And that happened so fast that I had this rise. In literally the past 12 months, it’s just gone crazy, bonkers. This interview has been edited and condensed.

I think I cried, laughed and had some amazing conversations at dinner. Related Stories KLOS-FM Radio Host Uncle Joe Benson Dies at 76 “I think especially right now, there’s so much bad news that there aren’t conversations around people who are doing great, amazing things and uplifting those people and highlighting those people,” Delevingne continues. “I think it is something…we need so badly.” Popular on Variety Since its launch in 2005, Women of Worth has grown into a nationwide movement, recognizing 200 women by providing them with mentorship and grants, community and national visibility for their grassroots efforts. Delevingne has teamed up with L’Oreal — she’s a L’Oréal Paris ambassador — ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8 to talk about the importance of uplifting women’s voices and causes. The model and actress is currently focusing on issues related to mental health and marginalized communities. “We’re laughing and joking around a lot right now by saying, ‘Everything’s on fire,’” she said. “It’s become this dark humor around the fact that no one’s feeling great…Mental health is so important right now, being able to do good for yourself so you can do good by other people.” When she’s having a “shitty day,” Delevingne will scroll GoFundMe pages: “I like seeing an actual dent that you can make to help someone.” Conversations around mental health must include discussions about social media, Delevingne says. “That algorithm is not meant for good things,” she says. “I haven’t gotten to the point where I’ve deleted Instagram off my phone yet, but I’m constantly working on self-control because I find myself going on there without even realizing I am…It’s terrifying.” She works hard on course correcitng her algorithm. “I do follow a lot of accounts about doing good things and good news,” Delevingne says. “There’s this one account for good news about women. That always makes me happy because I feel like when the pendulum is swinging so far the other way — women’s rights are getting taken away, people of color or the queer community — we have to try and push it the other way. If I’m constantly in fear, then I just don’t leave the house, which then nothing is ever going to get done.” Nominations are currently open for L’Oréal Paris’ Women of Worth program for 2026 until March 8.

It took just 150 seconds of Saturday’s Goya Awards for co-host Luis Tosar, wearing a Palestine pin, to condemn “Gaza genocide” – with the audience pretty well unanimously bursting out in applause. Susan Sarandon, winner of this year’s International Goya of Honor, thanked Spanish President Pedro Sánchez and many artists from Spain who “talk with such moral lucidity.” “It helps me to feel less alone, part of a larger community,” in a world dominated by “cruelty” and “violence,” she added. “Dictators can govern countries by whims. That can be denying gender violence and climate change, invading countries and deporting immigrants,” said Joaquin Oristrell, a co-winner of adapted screenplay for “La Cena,” again to raucous applause, In her acceptance speech, Sarandon quoted American writer Howard Zinn: “To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic.

Dr. Jamal-Harrison Bryant was also honored with the prestigious Mildred Bond Roxborough Social Justice Impact Award. “Tonight we converge while the world is in crisis, knowing 117 years later that the NAACP is necessary,” Bryant said onstage. “I’m grateful that coming out of college, this organization saw my potential and made an investment in me by making me the youngest national youth and college director in their history, and allowed me an opportunity to find my voice and to find my space.” Then, Dr. Mary Anne Franks was presented with the NAACP-Archewell digital civil rights award with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, appearing via video.

The period vampire thriller — which led the Image Award nominations with 18 nods, including outstanding motion picture — won three categories: stunt ensemble, cinematography (Autumn Durald Arkapaw) and ensemble cast (Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O’Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, Buddy Guy, Delroy Lindo, Peter Dreimanis, Lola Kirke, Li Jun Li, Saul Williams and Yao). Coogler and Jordan’s previous collaborations, “Black Panther” and its sequel “Wakanda Forever,” also won the ensemble prize on the way to massive trophy hauls at their respective Image Awards telecasts. Wednesday night’s virtual ceremony, hosted by Angel “ThatChickAngel” Laketa Moore and Khleo Thomas, focused on the non-televised film, television, and writing award categories. Teyana Taylor — who is nominated for six Image Awards, including one for her role in “One Battle After Another” — picked up the prize for outstanding supporting actress in a TV movie, limited series or dramatic special for her work in “Tyler Perry’s Straw.” Her co-star in the Netflix thriller, Glynn Turman, won the supporting actor award. The late Malcolm-Jamal Warner won the prize for outstanding guest performance for his part in the Fox series “Murder in a Small Town.” It was the second Image Award win for the actor, who died last year at 54.

Cardi B won three Image Awards on Tuesday night, including outstanding female artist and outstanding album for her latest record “Am I the Drama?” Her track “ErrTime” won the prize for outstanding hip-hop/rap song. Before this year’s ceremony, Cardi B had won just one Image Award, for serving as judge and executive producer of “Rhythm & Flow.” Veteran journalist Don Lemon won two trophies for his eponymous talk show, “The Don Lemon Show”; Lemon’s news and talk series and Obama’s podcast “IMO,” which the former first lady co-hosts with her brother Craig Robinson, won four of the five awards presented for that medium. Lamar, who was also a big winner on the first night of the three-part virtual ceremony, added two more prizes on night two. The rapper was named outstanding male artist and shared the music video/visual album award with SZA for their Grammy-winning hit “Luther.” Coogler’s “Sinners” won its first awards out of its 18 nominations, collecting the prizes for outstanding soundtrack and original score.

Obama’s latest book, “The Look” — which explored her style evolution from her time in the White House to life afterwards — won the award for outstanding literary work biography/autobiography. Meanwhile, Lamar’s electrifying Super Bowl halftime performance was named outstanding short-form series or special – reality/nonfiction/documentary. Both Obama and Lamar are repeat winners at the Image Awards: she won in the same category in 2019 for her memoir “Becoming,” while he has nine trophies from the NAACP, including two for his 2025 anthem “Not Like Us.” The awards were announced during the first edition of a three-night virtual event, where winners will be revealed in the majority of the Image Awards’ more than 90 categories (across film, television and streaming, music, literature and podcasts). The pre-show ceremony, hosted by Angel “ThatChickAngel” Laketa Moore and Khleo Thomas, aired exclusively on YouTube and NAACP+ and focused primarily on the literary categories, as well as two digital content creator prizes.

Jordan received a standing ovation at the NAACP Image Awards By Angelique Jackson Plus Icon Angelique Jackson angelique814 Latest Delroy Lindo Thanks Supporters After BAFTA N-Word Incident: ‘It’s a Classic Case of Something That Could Be Very Negative Becoming Very Positive’ 2 hours ago NAACP Image Awards 2026 Winners (Updating Live) 2 hours ago ‘G.I. Joe’ Reboots in the Works at Paramount; Max Landis Pitching a Script Years After #MeToo Allegations Derailed Career 1 day ago See All Getty Images It didn’t take long for the NAACP Image Awards to show “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo some love following an incident at last weekend’s BAFTA Awards. During the international ceremony, the BBC broadcast an outburst from a Tourette’s campaigner that included a racial slur, which was uttered while the actors were on stage. While presenting the first award of the NAACP ceremony on Saturday, “One Battle After Another” star Regina Hall asked the audience to “take a moment for the two kings who are in this audience,” gesturing toward Jordan and Lindo seated inside the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where the awards ceremony is being held. Related Stories KLOS-FM Radio Host Uncle Joe Benson Dies at 76 “[I] just send you so much love for your class,” Hall told the actors while the well-heeled crowd jumped to their feet to salute them. Popular on Variety The BAFTA incident has dominated headlines for the past week, as representatives for BAFTA and John Davidson, the Tourette syndrome campaigner at the center of the controversy, issued statements and apologies . In an exclusive interview with Variety , Davidson said he “felt a wave of shame” in the moment he realized the crowd could hear his involuntary tics and questioned why he was seated so close to a microphone. However, further questions about why the BBC aired the moment in a tape-delayed broadcast — and after “Sinners” studio Warner Bros. requested for the moment to be edited out — continue to keep the situation in the news. Hall’s call for the impromptu ovation followed a pointed joke by comedian Deon Cole, who returned as host of the Image Awards telecast. Cole framed his opening monologue like a prayer, with jokes about Teyana Taylor’s relationship status, 50 Cent’s pettiness and Nicki Minaj’s politics. Cole finished the bit by saying, “Lord, if there are any white men out here in the audience with Tourette’s, I advise you to tell them they better read the room tonight.” After Hall and Cole’s shoutouts, “Abbott Elementary” star Quinta Brunson — who won the NAACP Image Award for outstanding actress in a comedy series — also took a moment to celebrate the “Sinners” cast and crew. “We see you. We are behind you,” Brunson said. “We support you, and we love you.” Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” is the most-nominated project at this year’s Image Awards, with Jordan also vying for the Entertainer of the Year prize. Later in the ceremony, LIndo took the stage to present an award with “Sinners” filmmaker Ryan Coogler, welcomed by another standing ovation. “Before we start, I’d just like to officially say, we appreciate — I appreciate — we appreciate all the support and the love that we have been shown in the aftermath of what happened last weekend. It means a lot to us,” Lindo began, while the crowd clapped and cheered. Ryan Coogler and Delroy Lindo speak onstage during the 57th NAACP Image Awards. Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET “It is an honor to be here amongst our people this evening,” he continued. “Among so many people who have shown us such incredible support. And it’s a classic case of something that could be very negative becoming very positive.” Coogler, too, acknowledged the importance of being among the Black community at the Image Awards. “There’s something powerful about standing in this room — a room where we don’t have to explain ourselves, or our stories aren’t footnotes,” he said. “They’re the main text.” “A room where being fully seen is not rare, it is expected,” Lindo chimed in, as the two began to trade lines of the presenters’ copy. “And that matters, because so much of what we do on screen and behind the scenes is about fighting to be understood,” Coogler continued, as Lindo added: “To be layered. Complex. To be human.” “Nights like this remind us that when we tell our stories truthfully, we show up as we are. We create space for each other,” Coogler said. “Space to grow. Space to lead. Space to shine,” Lindo said. “So it’s an honor to stand here together, not just as collaborators, not just as Oakland residents,” Coogler quipped, never missing a moment to shout out his Bay Area roots. “But as part of a community that continues to move culture forward.” Just a few minutes later, Jordan took the stage to accept the award for outstanding lead actor and reflected on why he’s always placed importance on attending the Image Awards — even going so far as sneaking in earlier in his career. “Man, I love being Black,” he declared, raising the trophy triumphantly.

But the big question going into British music’s biggest awards ceremony was, would the awards themselves need a similar name change? Well, let’s just call them the Olivias, shall we? Dean – who, with her Grammy win for Best New Artist has become a focal point for the British music resurgence – picked up four of the five awards she was up for: Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Pop Act and a share of Song of the Year for her duet with Sam Fender on “Rein Me In.” She also pulled off one of the performances of the night with a delightfully breezy “Man I Need,” embodying her old school mainstream appeal. Popular on Variety Related Stories Park Chan-wook to Preside Over 79th Cannes Film Festival Jury Ed Helms and Nat Wolff Join Rachel Zegler in Comedy Drama 'She Gets It From Me' And, while Charli xcx, Raye and Harry Styles have similarly dominated Britain’s leading awards ceremony in recent years, Dean’s success was all the more meaningful because this was no walkover. She faced meaningful opposition from equally worthy potential winners in every category, with genuine global U.K. success stories suddenly seemingly everywhere. Perhaps that’s why her multiple tearful acceptance speeches all seemed charmingly overwhelmed to the point of befuddlement, barely mustering a quote of note between them (“This album is just about love, and loving each other in a world that feels loveless right now,” was about as headline-grabbing as it got). No matter: plenty of other people stepped up on that front. This was a vintage Brits, packed full of talking points, incidents and a general air of unpredictability in a way we haven’t seen since the peak Britpop era in the mid-‘90s. Returning superstar Harry Styles kicked things off with a bang via a bravura performance of “Aperture” from his hotly anticipated “Kiss All the Time, Disco Occasionally” album, which comes out this Friday. Raye went full James Bond theme with a brassy combo of “Where Is My Husband?” and “Nightingale Lane.” And Wolf Alice marked their transition from plucky indie types to full-on rock stars with a stunning acoustic version of “The Sofa,” set in a living room, that ended with frontwoman Ellie Rowsell lifted high by her backing dancers. The band also picked up Group of the Year, with Rowsell speaking up for better support for grassroots venues and artists themselves, declaring: “This shouldn’t feel like a golden ticket, but a viable career decision.” In recent years, the Brits have relied heavily on international artists to provide the star power, but overall this year’s contingent were rather more mundane. An exception was International Artist of the Year winner Rosalía, who provided some edge with a dramatic take on “Berghain” that featured an attention-grabbing appearance from Björk; Rosalía also did a surprisingly good Liam Gallagher impression in a chat with host Jack Whitehall. But Alex Warren’s performance of “Ordinary” lived up to its name, despite the presence of James Blunt on piano (“James Blunt without a microphone – everyone’s a winner,” quipped Whitehall); the KPop Demon Hunters performance was pre-recorded so failed to connect in the room; Sombr’s obviously staged altercation with a pretend-stage-invader barely registered in a cynical industry section that has seen plenty of actual Brits stage invasions over the years. More authentic controversy came from Whitehall in trademark near-the-knuckle form, with his jokes about the Epstein files being censored from the live broadcast (notably “I think that I saw Peter Mandelson on the guest list,” referencing the former ambassador to the U.S. who was arrested in connection with the files). He also goaded Happy Mondays legends Shaun Ryder and Bez into making slanderous remarks about Paddington Bear, while Geese bassist Max Bassin declared, “Free Palestine, fuck ICE” as he picked up the International Group of the Year award, and Noel Gallagher concluded his Best Songwriter acceptance speech with “Up the fucking Blues” — a Manchester City soccer reference that brought forth an avalanche of boos (with half of Manchester supporting the other Manchester team, United). But, really, tonight was about British music regaining its confidence to the point where you wondered if some of those international slots might better have gone to U.K. stars. Breakthrough Artist winner Lola Young performed “Messy” at last year’s ceremony, but surely deserved a return, while Lily Allen – maker of “West End Girl,” the most talked-about album of the year and one of the best – sadly did not perform, despite rumors she was in negotiations for a slot. This embarrassment of riches not only elevated the TV spectacle, but also the atmosphere in the Co-op Live Arena (which has successfully bounced back from its disastrous opening in 2024). The buzz around the awards eased its potentially tricky transition to Manchester, with the industry turning out in force. There was a strong “school trip” atmosphere on the various specially chartered trains up from Manchester – something you don’t get on the tube to the O2 – and a strong international presence: UMG EVP Andrew Kronfeld, Republic Records’ co-founder Monte Lipman, Warner Records co-chairman Tom Corson and Sony Music boss Rob Stringer (fresh from watching his beloved Luton Town soccer club play at nearby Port Vale in the afternoon) were among those spotted in the city or on the arena floor, as well as U.K. presidents and CEOs Dickon Stainer (Universal), Jason Iley (Sony), Jo Charrington (Capitol), Louis Bloom (Island EMI Label Group), Ben Mortimer (Polydor Label Group), Tom Lewis (Fontana) and Dipesh Parmar (Columbia), plus a remarkably chilled-looking Stacey Tang, RCA U.K. co-president and this year’s BRITs chair/showrunner. And there was also a real buzz across the city in the nights before, with Universal Music holding a spectacular showcase at the Aviva Studios, featuring Simon Cowell’s new boyband December 10, plus Flo and Holly Humberstone; Island Records putting on new acts Keo, Dermot Henry and Sinéad Ashiokai at Yes; and underplay shows from the likes of Olivia Dean, the Foo Fighters and Robbie Williams. Williams also featured at the Awards, fronting the tribute to Ozzy Osbourne that accompanied Ozzy’s posthumous Lifetime Achievement award. Williams was hand-picked by Sharon Osbourne, who paid emotional tribute to her “gorgeous husband”, declaring, “There will never be another fucking Ozzy Osbourne.” But the Prince of Darkness being portrayed by the King of Light Entertainment on a version of “No More Tears” still raised plenty of eyebrows. It shouldn’t have worked – and it didn’t really, despite the best efforts of the band, featuring many musicians that played with Osbourne over the years. Thankfully, a tide of emotion carried things through, with more poignant notes struck as the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess paid tribute to one of Manchester’s favorite sons, Gary “Mani” Mounfield of the Stone Roses and Primal Scream. Outstanding Contribution winner Mark Ronson also remembered his former musical partner Amy Winehouse in both his speech (“The music I made with Amy is the reason other people know who I am”) and his performance, which featured Winehouse’s voice, first hauntingly on “Back to Black” and then joyously, on “Valerie.” Ronson was also joined by Ghostface Killah and Dua Lipa, in full show-stopping mode, in one of the night’s highlights. Another rock legend, Noel Gallagher – a local lad and the man behind 2025’s biggest UK cultural moment in the form of the Oasis reunion tour – somewhat controversially picked up the Songwriter Of The Year award: the fourth time in the awards’ five-year history that it’s gone to someone best known as an artist (and, in this case, one who gladly admitted he hasn’t actually written a song in two years). Perhaps that was why Gallagher was relatively self-deprecating in his acceptance speech, paying tribute to his brother and band members. “They brought these songs to life – without them, I’d just be a singer-songwriter and no one gives a shit about singer-songwriters”. The success of Dean and Fender – who also picked up the Alternative/Rock Act prize – might suggest otherwise. But, as the biz drifted off to the after show parties – which also made the trip north, with Sony Music taking over Soho House and Warner Music partying hard at the Cut & Craft – it was obvious the Brits 2026 had been – as its principle winner might sing – the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life. Which should, hopefully, make it easy to fall in love with British music all over again.

When asked “what would break your heart if it disappeared from LA,” the Oscar nominee praised “immigrants” as just as detrimental to the city’s identity as filmmaking and fast food. “I can’t stand the idea that the dismantling of the culture that did have a hand in making me who I am—which is so meaningless in the face of people’s lives being completely unearthed, uprooted, destroyed—this is not who we are,” she told Architectural Digest . “Where I’m from, I don’t identify with that right now.” Related Stories News Springsteen Set To Perform In Minneapolis At Anti-ICE National Shutdown Protest; The Boss Released Song Days Ago Slamming Trump & Recent Killings News Kristen Stewart Buys Highland Theatre, Plans To Create “Something For The Community … Not Just Pretentious Hollywood Cinephiles” Stewart continued, “And so, I definitely am dying every day, thinking, ‘So, do we make movies about this?

In the Kevin Williamson-helmed seventh installment of the slasher franchise, which he launched in 1996 as writer with director Wes Craven, Sidney is living a peaceful small-town life far away from Woodsboro and the trauma it holds. With her cop husband Mark Evans (Joel McHale) and teen daughter Tatum (Isabel May), Sidney finds herself the target of another masked killer, who attempts to convince her that he’s Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), one of the original Ghostfaces she thought she killed.

Watch on Deadline The mastermind behind this round of Ghostface attacks is revealed to be Jessica Bowden (Anna Camp), Sid’s next door neighbor and best friend, who became obsessed with her after Sidney’s book Out of Darkness encouraged her to kill her abusive husband. But when Sidney wasn’t present at the New York killings in Scream VI (2023), which Campbell sat out over a pay dispute , Jessica felt abandoned. She checked herself into a mental health facility, where she hatched a plan for the killings with hospital staffer Marco (Ethan Embry) and fellow patient Karl (Kraig Dane). In November, Camp caught up with Deadline at the OUT100 celebration, where we accurately guessed she would be revealed as the killer. “A lot of people are saying that,” said Camp. “I can’t obviously say anything, but I will take that kind of as a compliment, because that role is definitely for somebody who has to be able to bring the whole movie home.

Michael Buckner/PMC/Kristina Bumphrey/PMC/Jesse Grant/PMC/Gilbert Flores/PMC/Jesse Grant/PMC Every producer has a story to tell when it comes to revealing the challenges they faced when making an awards-worthy movie, but it was Weapons ‘ Miri Yoon who hit the nail on the head during a celebration Saturday for this year’s PGA Awards nominees for Theatrical Motion Picture. “Everything’s hard. Producing is hard. It is ghetto. It is difficult. There are problems to fix every damn day. It never ends,” Yoon said during a panel at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills. “Even with us, it was like with a lot of people on this panel. We had a cast, we had a budget, we had a schedule. We’re ready to go. The strike hit. We had to rebuild the entire cast. We were shooting in beautiful, wonderful Atlanta, with an incredible crew, but in the dead ass of summer, while we were trying to be the fall in the Pacific Northwest. And then we had kids, 17 of them, and their parents.” Related Stories News PGA Awards 2026 Winners List For Children's, Sports, Shortform & Innovation Categories News PGA Awards Postpones Tonight's Children's & Sports NYC Ceremony Amid Blizzard “So yeah, it was freakin’ brutal, guys, but it’s amazing,” continued Yoon, who was joined on stage by Bugonia ‘s Lars Knudsen, F1 ‘s Jerry Bruckheimer, Frankenstein ‘s Guillermo del Toro, Hamnet ‘s Pippa Harris, Marty Supreme ‘s Eli Bush, One Battle After Another ‘s Sara Murphy, Sentimental Value ‘s Andrea Berentsen Ottmar, Sinners ‘ Sev Ohanian and Train Dreams ‘ Teddy Schwarzman. All are up for the Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures at tonight’s PGA Awards. Watch on Deadline “At the end of the day, the way I see our jobs as producers is that we’re in the service industry,” Yoon told moderator Jess Cagle. “We’re in service of a crew that’s busting their asses for us. We’re in service of actors who are putting their craft front and center. We’re in service to whomever is financing the movie. And we’re in service of the filmmaker and the vision they’re bringing to the table.” The other nominees got a chance to share the types of challenges they faced while making their memorable movies. For Bugonia ‘s Knudsen, it was time; it took eight years to remake the 2003 South Korean film Save the Green Planet! by Jang Joon-hwan. For Bruckheimer, it was getting the F1 screenplay right, considering how many drivers, races and promoters were involved in the worldwide production. For Bush, it was teaching a sea lion how to play ping pong. For Murphy, it was having to deal with the passing of producer Adam Somner and the temporary absence of Benicio Del Toro, who had to go off to shoot The Phoenician Scheme for Wes Anderson. For Harris, it was rebuilding the Old Globe Theatre. And for Ohanian, it was dealing with the unexpected appearance of gators on location and making the horror movie’s surreal montage. “I hope we got an A,” he said. The producers were then asked to explain how they got their start in the biz. Nothing could beat Del Toro’s childhood memories of shooting a Super 8 film about a killer potato who ultimately gets run over by a car, but stories from Ohanian, Ottmar and Schwarzman came close. The Sinners producer recalled how his 2007 YouTube video about an Armenian dad who chews out his son for crashing the car went viral; Ottmar explained how she pivoted from studying engineering at the University of Washington to working as a personal assistant for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in the aughts; and Schwarzman, a former lawyer, regaled the audience about how he concocted a 20-year plan that went from attending law school to somehow managing to solve a big Hollywood problem while riding up an imaginary elevator with Tinseltown muckety-mucks. “I knew that they were going to have a problem that they were talking about in the elevator, and I would give them my idea, and then they would realize that there’s, like, creative merit, and I could get into the creative side of filmmaking,” Schwarzman said. “So that was my plan. That’s why I was a lawyer, which again, tells you that I am a terrible student and a terrible employee and probably a terrible strategist.” “But a good storyteller,” remarked del Toro. The Producers Guild will honor a trio of industry heavyweights with career honors this weekend. Blumhouse’s Jason Blum will receive the Milestone Award, Spider-Verse franchise producer Amy Pascal is set for the David O. Zelznick Achievement Award, and Mara Brock Akil will be presented with the Norman Lear Achievement Award.

The dissident film body said in a statement that Iran’s “defenseless citizens” had had “no option but to seek urgent humanitarian intervention from the international community” in the wake of their government’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in January. As many as 30,000 people are believed to have been killed by officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who fired indiscriminately into crowds as they sought to disband pro-democracy demonstrations on January 8 and 9. Watch on Deadline Related Stories News Iran's Supreme Leader \"Dead,\" Trump Posts; Iran Says Not True As U.S. & Israeli Strikes Continues News U.S. And Israel Launch Strikes On Iran; Trump Says Reports Of Iran Supreme Leader's Death Are \"Correct\" - Update “For decades this regime has squandered national wealth on nuclear and military infrastructure while imposing harsh sanctions that have devastated the populace,” said IIFMA, which was created by exiled Iranian cinema professionals in the wake of the 2022 Woman Life Freedom movement, sparked by the killing of Mahsa Amini in police custody. “Its recent cowardly attacks on neighboring countries reveal its weakening grasp on power,” it added, referring to retaliatory Iranian missile attacks on Saturday on a number of Gulf states including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. “In this context, IIFMA calls upon the international community to uphold Iran’s sovereignty and to prioritize the protection of tens of millions of citizens held hostage by the Islamic regime. We advocate for targeted actions against government officials and oppressive agents while avoiding harm to innocent civilians. It is essential to put an end to this archaic cycle of patriarchal violence.” The body also raised its concern “for the lives of all prisoners, especially those involved in the ongoing Revolution”. “We are alarmed by the regime’s deceitful tactics, which may lead to a repeat of the Cinema Rex tragedy, where blame for civilian deaths is shifted onto foreign actors,” it said. The infamous Cinema Rex arson attack in the city of Abadan in southwest Iran in August 1978, in which Islamic extremists barred the doors of the theater and set it alight, killing up to 470 people, is seen as a trigger for the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in which the Islamic Regime come to power. It has since been proved it was the work of a quartet of Islamic revolutionaries, but claims at the time that it was a false flag operation orchestrated by the SAVAK secret police agents of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, turned public opinion and helped fuel the revolution. IIFMA’s statement was released towards the end of a fast-moving day in which the U.S. and Israel launched hundreds of missiles on strategic sites across Iran , following a pre-recorded video message from Trump that the operation was aimed at stopping the country’s nuclear campaign and bringing about regime change. Later in the day, Trump confirmed reports out of Israel that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been killed after his Tehran compound was pounded by at least 30 strikes, although Iranian officials have denied his death. The surprise military operation has provoked a mixed response with anger in some quarters at home in the U.S. over the fact Trump launched the operation without consulting Congress, and concern worldwide that the situation could escalate out of control and wreak death and destruction across the Middle East. “In these challenging times, it is only through united resistance against theocracy that we can hope to end violence and forge a path toward lasting peace and freedom. True peace is not merely the absence of conflict; it is built upon the foundation of genuine liberty and dignity for all,” said IIFMA.

The news comes hours after Donald Trump proclaimed the harsh 37-year rule of the cleric had ended with the US and Israeli attack on Iran . With dozens of other members of the Iranian leadership also dead, Khamenei was said to have died in his official office in the early hours of the first wave of attacks on Iran by US and Israeli air forces. “The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution was martyred at their workplace in the Leader’s Residence,” official Iranian media tweeted just minutes ago.. “At the moment of martyrdom, they were carrying out their assigned duties and present at their workplace (their office), and this cowardly attack occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning.” Related Stories News U.S. And Israel Launch Strikes On Iran; Trump Says Reports Of Iran Supreme Leader's Death Are \"Correct\" - Update News Brit Awards Host Jack Whitehall Takes Jab At BAFTAs Over Racial Slur Incident: \"We've Got The Best In The Business On The Bleep Button\" As the Islamic Republic uncharacteristically quickly acknowledged Khamenei’s death, no successor has been announced. Added to that, with celebrations breaking out in Iran following weeks of massive protests against the regime, Israel has launched a series of new strikes on Iran. Watch on Deadline News of the official confirmation of Khamenei’s killing spread within seconds online and on cable news, which has been covering the situation in Iran and the region wall-to-wall since late last Friday. Trump said today that this weekend’s Operation Epic Fury barrage was just the start of a “massive and ongoing” operation of regime change and to end Iran’s long running nuclear program. To that, U.S. Central Command posted a missile strike video just as news of Khamenei’s death was revealed with tears and promises of 40 days of mourning in Iran. The Iranian regime was warned. CENTCOM is now delivering swift and decisive action as directed. pic.twitter.com/nNDoDexH6g — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) March 1, 2026 PREVIOUSLY, 2:04 PM: Iran’s Supreme Leader is dead, Donald Trump has proclaimed in a lengthy social media post. However, under bombardment from American and Israeli forces, the Iranian government still insists Ali Khamenei is alive, though no one has seen the much-feared cleric in days. “Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote this afternoon at 1:37 p.m. PT. As the BBC noted soon after the openly regime-change-seeking Trump posted, there has still been “no independent verification” of Khamenei’s death. Iranian State media is saying, as it has been all day, that the 86-year-old Khamenei is alive. Just before Trump posted, Khamenei’s own X feed put up a defiant image of a sword-wielding figure and more Shia warrior symbolism. به نام نامی حیدر علیه‌السلام pic.twitter.com/n848j6KASq — KHAMENEI.IR | فارسی (@Khamenei_fa) February 28, 2026 At the same time, as American and Israeli forces once again attempted to halt Iran’s nuclear program, satellite images show the top cleric’s residence was destroyed in Operation Epic Fury. Also, publicly unveiled plans for Khamenei to address the Islamic Republic were shelved. Still, with no solid word of what the state of the murderous Revolutionary Guard and the Iranian military are and who they are backing, Trump had no such caution about the Iranian leader’s future in his own post. “This is not only Justice for the people of Iran, but for all Great Americans, and those people from many Countries throughout the World, that have been killed or mutilated by Khamenei and his gang of bloodthirsty THUGS,” POTUS added from his Mar-a-lago estate in Florida With rumors of the fate of Khamenei, who has ruled Iran since 1989, swirling in the hours after the first attacks on Tehran, cable news outlets scrambled to pivot as Trump made his announcement. Broadcast networks such as CBS shuffled their programming lineups to get primetime specials on “War with Iran” on air tonight On CNN , guests like former Trump National Security Adviser, the retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who was recently named as a CBS News contributor, tried to provide instant context of what the immediate fallout could be. In American cities like Los Angeles, anti-Khamenei protesters were celebrating on the streets and online within minutes of Trump’s posting. As MS Now , the BBC, Fox News and CNN brought on their top anchors for coverage, the still-Warner Bros. Discovery-own cable net also reported that “celebrations” were taking place in Tehran over reports of Khamanei’s death. The Iranian capital, like many cities and regions in the country, has seen mass protests and mass killings by the regime over the past few months. Speaking on Israeli TV earlier Saturday, PM Benjamin Netanyahu referred to Khemenei as “no longer” in charge, a significant choice of words. Earlier Saturday, Trump spoke of Khamenei being dead, and told NBC in a phone call interview that “we feel that that is a correct story.” As various members of the Iranian elite were also said to be wiped out, Trump added: “The people that make all the decisions, most of them are gone.” In a White House-supplied photo, Donald Trump with (L-R) CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Feb. 28, 2026 in Palm Beach, Fla. At the same time as Trump posted, a United Nations Security Council meeting continued. Condemning the “hostile” U.S. and Israel for having broken international law and the U.N. charter, Iranian representatives stuck to their script and weaved away from any confirmation of Khamenei’s death. Also Saturday, Trump said the strikes on Iran, which today had fired back at U.S. bases, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and American allies in the Middle East, would go on for several more days. Exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has emerged as a possible ruler of a new Iran, also took to social media after Trump. Calling Khamenei “the bloodthirsty despot of our time,” the 65-year-old son of the last Shah, whose own brutal and bloodthirsty regime was overthrown in 1979 in the Ayatollah Khomeini-led revolution, told officials in Iran to switch sides. “This is your final opportunity to join the nation, to help ensure Iran’s stable transition to a free and prosperous future, and to take part in building that future,” the U.K.-residing Pahlavi, who has spent most of his life outside Iran, wrote. My fellow compatriots, Ali Khamenei, the bloodthirsty despot of our time, the murderer of tens of thousands of Iran’s bravest sons and daughters, has been erased from the face of history. With his death, the Islamic Republic has in effect reached its end and will very soon be… https://t.co/pm3ZXY9IYZ — Reza Pahlavi (@PahlaviReza) February 28, 2026 Paramount And WBD Reveal Details Of $110B Deal: Latest News + Analysis ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Sinners’ ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Win: Full List On The Set Of The ‘Peaky Blinders’ Movie With Cillian Murphy & The Rest Of The Gang Read More About: 5 Comments"

Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Shia LaBeouf has once again been arrested, this time on an additional charge of misdemeanor count of simple battery related to an incident earlier this month in which he assaulted several people in New Orleans, per the Associated Press . The actor was previously booked and posted bail in the aftermath of the Feb. 17 bar brawl , in which he punched patrons and shouted anti-gay slurs. The Transformers alum now faces three charges, with his next hearing scheduled for March 19. City police previously said LaBeouf was “causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive” at a Royal Street business outside the French Quarter. LaBeouf’s attorney Sarah Chervinsky told the AP that LaBeouf voluntarily turned himself in to the Orleans Parish Prison upon learning of the new arrest warrant issued yesterday. Watch on Deadline Related Stories News Shia LaBeouf Posts \"Free Me\" After Being Arrested At Mardi Gras Party Legal Shia LaBeouf And FKA Twigs Settle Sexual Battery Suit - Update “No regular person would be required to post over $100,000 in bonds, and be jailed two separate times for one misdemeanor incident,” Chervinsky said. “Just as he does not deserve preferential treatment, Mr. LaBeouf also does not deserve to be treated more harshly by the police and courts just because he is a public figure.” The news comes amid LaBeouf’s sprawling interview with Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan , during which he rambled about his past legal issues, sobriety journey, religious beliefs and former relationships with artist FKA Twigs and actress Mia Goth. At one point, he left the interview couch to grab a beer and, toward the conclusion of the conversation, walked away and accidentally broke his wall. “I fucked up, it’s on me,” he said of the New Orleans arrest. “It was no good, bro. My behavior’s dirty, ugly, disgusting, so I gotta eat it, you know?” LaBeouf also posited he may still be charged with a hate crime, which carries a more severe penalty, though in some statements he expressed a cavalier attitude toward his latest controversy. “Who gives a fuck though? It’s another experience. Jail be another adventure. What are you gonna do?” he said. Despite having attended support groups for addiction previously, he said, “I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I think I have a different problem, and I’m gonna address it … I think I have a small man complex. Some kind of Napoleonic, I don’t know what it is. I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more than my drinking.” He added that he has often been “forced to get sober by the court system, usually, and then women get scared, so you gotta stay sober for the girl.” In more eyebrow-raising comments, he admitted his bigotry is “why I got arrested.” “Big, gay people are scary to me,” he said, saying that when three gay men “are touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry. If that’s homophobic, then I’m that.” He said he gets triggered when his “masculinity is challenged,” adding, “I’m good with gay, be gay over there though, don’t be gay in my lap.” Later, he pivoted: “I am wrong for touching anyone ever and that’s the end of my statement on this whole shit.” LaBeouf also confirmed that once released from jail (he said he didn’t know who bailed him out), he returned to party in the French Quarter during Mardi Gras. This isn’t the first time the Disturbia actor has been embroiled in unsavory dealings. The former child star-turned-embattled figure was previously sued by ex-girlfriend Twigs for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, which was later settled . Of that matter, he admitted to Callaghan: “Whatever she said, run with most of it.” Paramount And WBD Reveal Details Of $110B Deal: Latest News + Analysis ‘Scream 7’ Is Slaying: Pic Eyes Franchise-Best $60M+ In Opening Frame ‘Sinners’ ‘One Battle’ & ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Win: Full List On The Set Of The ‘Peaky Blinders’ Movie With Cillian Murphy & The Rest Of The Gang Read More About: Comments"

      "full_text": "× Skip to main content By Thomas Doherty Plus Icon Thomas Doherty View All February 28, 2026 5:59am Actor statuettes being cast ahead of the 9th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, circa 2003. Getty Images On February 25, 1995, NBC telecast the inaugural presentation of what would become an annual ritual, the conferral of awards by the Screen Actors Guild, with the honorees from both the film and television screens chosen by the group’s 77,615 members. “For the first time, the people who are in the trenches and make their living as performers will have a chance to express their appreciation for the outstanding work of their colleagues,” exulted SAG president Barry Gordon. SAG was late in jumping onto the awards bandwagon. The Screen Writers Guild had been giving out trophies since 1949, when among the winners were John Huston and B. Traven for best written American Western for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . The Directors Guild of America also began presenting annual awards in 1949, when Joseph L. Mankiewicz won for A Letter to Three Wives . Related Stories Business As Video Podcasts Boom, SAG-AFTRA Looks to Organize the Industry Business SAG-AFTRA President Sounds Alarm Over Local TV Station Layoffs Across U.S. “We are the most modest and self-effacing guild,” explained Patrick Stewart with a straight face. In truth, however, SAG members wore their union label with pride. More than a required visa for the closed shop of big-time film and television work, it was a prized marker of professional identity. Tom Hanks in 1995. Vince Bucci/AFP When Tom Hanks won the best actor award for Forrest Gump that night, he posed not only with the statuette — a naked guy with no mouth or genitals holding up the Greek masks of tragedy and comedy — but with his SAG card. From wry self-effacement, the Screen Actors Guild has suddenly opted for self-erasure. On November 14, the guild announced that its flagship awards ceremony, scheduled for streaming on Netflix on March 1, 2026, would henceforth be known as “The Actors Awards presented by SAG-AFTRA.” The demotion from network to Netflix may be a necessary concession to technology and the marketplace, but the decision to rebrand, or rather un-brand, the SAG awards is a judgment call, and a bad one. Why lower the protective shield of the guild and diminish its luster when scabs like “ Tilly Norwood ” are seeking to undermine worker solidarity? Upon announcing the name change, SAG-AFTRA explained the rationale. Since the trophy has always been called The Actor, “evolving the show’s name to align with the award itself made obvious sense,” it said. Moreover, “the refreshed name will also help introduce [the show] to new global audiences,” who presumably would need the initials translated. The PR dialogue insists — repeatedly — that otherwise everything “remains the same” — really, “exactly the same.” Basically, it’s no big deal and why make a fuss? The founding generation of screen actors, who fought hard and risked much to establish a labor union for the profession, would still likely balk at the deletion of the name. Born in the nadir of the Great Depression, SAG began as an act of self-preservation in response to demands by the major Hollywood studios that the talent pool eat a 50 percent salary cut. In March 1933, MGM chieftain Louis B. Mayer, one of the best actors on the lot, called a mass meeting of his “family” of employees to tearfully plead with them to take a hit for team, otherwise MGM would face bankruptcy. Lionel Barrymore, who could afford to be generous, was so moved by Mayer’s histrionics he said he’d take a 75 percent pay cut if necessary. Barrymore’s noble gesture did not inspire imitation. “It’s about time for everybody to start a Guild,” advised The Hollywood Reporter . Screen stars Ralph Bellamy, Jeanette MacDonald, James Dunn at a meeting of the Screen Actors Guild, 1933 Everett Everybody did. In 1933, Hollywood’s screenwriters, directors, and actors each came together (albeit separately) to form a united front against the front office. Each job description chose to call their organization a guild rather than a union to emphasize the skilled craftsmanship needed to make the grade. Guild also sounded less, well, blue collar. On October 8, 1933, more than 800 actors — stars and bit players alike — attended the first large scale organizational meeting at the El Capitan Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Eddie Cantor, the popular and politically savvy star of stage, screen, and radio, presided over the meeting and was chosen as first president. He called for a “100 percent actor organization” that would be “of, by, and for actors alone.” The guild would have one mission — the protection of actors. “Some Academy members say we are going screwy forming a Guild organization,” he said. “But we are not screwy. We just want to be 100 percent represented in an organization not subsidized by anyone.” Cantor was referring to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, formed in 1927 and seen as a company union whose main purpose was less to honor excellence in the motion picture arts than to keep a tight rein on artists who wanted a bigger slice of the pie. 503 actors resigned from the actors’ branch of the Academy and signed up on the spot for the new Screen Actors’ Guild (which soon ditched the apostrophe). Cantor was ready to play hardball. “Don’t work — and let them make their own pictures,” he said to raucous applause. By then, the studio heads had backed off the draconian pay cuts, but a new pickpocket had arrived from Washington: a Code for the Motion Picture Industry put forward under the authority of the National Recovery Act, the enabling legislation for FDR’s New Deal. (The NRA Code is not to be confused with the Production Code Administration, the self-regulatory censorship agency established by the industry itself in 1934.) The dread possibility of salary caps was on the table — and in 1933 soaking the rich stars was popular public policy. What really burned the actors was that the NRA Code allowed producers to give bonuses to themselves but threatened them with fines if they were too generous to the talent. “We deplore the attempt to saddle the sins of these financial buccaneers on the creative talent of the business,” SAG telegraphed FDR. Yes, Mae West was paid more than “the President, his cabinet, and the whole Senate and Congress combined,” but she had singlehandedly kept Paramount Pictures afloat and its employees off the breadlines. The NRA backed off and in 1935 was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The other existential threat to SAG in the 1930s came not from the moguls or the feds but the mob. Having infiltrated the trade unions — notably the powerful International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, whose pension fund doubled as an ATM for IATSE president George E. Browne and on-site enforcer Willie Bioff — the coffers of the guild beckoned as the next alluring slush fund. In 1939, the Chicago-schooled hoodlums tried to muscle in on SAG, claiming jurisdiction over all theatrical workers — not just stage hands but anyone working on a set, including the actors. SAG refused to be intimidated and went public with the real-life gangster melodrama. “It is a fight against the insolent attempt of George Browne and Willie Bioff to gobble organized actors into their personally owned and operated IATSE,” the guild declared in an ad in THR. The actors likened the racketeers to the Nazis, evoking Neville Chamberlain at Munich (“we will not meet with you under the umbrellas of appeasement”) and the annexation of Austria (“like Mr. Hitler, Mr. Browne — not content with being the fuhrer of the Stagehands International — now says he will Anschluss the actors.”) Screen Actors Guild President George Murphy addressing a meeting of the membership, 1945 Everett Leading the resistance was MGM star and SAG president Robert Montgomery. “Without question, Bob Montgomery is the hero of this story,” recalled song and dance man George Murphy, who himself served as SAG president from 1944-1946. “He inspired the rest of us to stand up to the gangsters threatening our industry.” In 1941, in part with evidence collected by SAG, Browne and Bioff were convicted of extortion and sentenced, respectively, to eight and ten years in prison. Perhaps because the marquee stars in SAG had a sense that only a lucky break had kept them from being a face in the crowd, the guild kept a protective eye out for the names not listed in the credits. Extras, usually treated on set like living props, were especially in need of protection. “The extra always has been an occasional worker — to be used when there was work for him, the same as any migrant field worker,” scoffed a producer in a widely quoted remark that infuriated the rank and file. SAG insisted on fair payment ($7.50 to $15.00 per day in 1934) and promotion to “day player” status ($25) if the extra spoke a line of dialogue or did a bit. SAG took other proactive measures. In 1939, disturbed by reports that the staff of Central Casting, the agency founded in 1926 to channel extras into studio crowd scenes, was taking payoffs, favoring relatives, and extorting sexual favors from extras and day players, SAG hired former FBI agents to investigate the agency. Three tough customers — Joan Crawford, James Cagney, and John Garfield — were placed in charge of monitoring the investigation. The result was a shake-up in the Central Casting leadership, the adoption of strict rules against nepotism, and oversight by a SAG representative in the office “with a view to curbing favoritism.”(The classification of screen extras as card carrying members of SAG was in fact a nettlesome intramural issue for the guild. In 1945, extras established their own union, the Screen Extras Guild, which was dissolved in 1992, when SAG absorbed its duties and membership.) Seated front from left: Joan Blondell, Dick Powell at the Screen Actors Guild party at the Cocoanut Grove, 1938. Throughout the politically charged 1930s, when the membership of the Screen Writers Guild could seem as concerned about the Spanish Civil War as the rules for allocating screenwriting credit, SAG mainly avoided partisan activism. In classic trade union fashion, the guild kept its eye on bread-and-butter issues — overtime, lunch breaks, sick days. The non-thespian causes SAG supported were unassailable–donations to the Red Cross or benefits for the March of Dimes crusade against polio. Individual actors might lend their name to a Popular Front group or appear at a political fundraiser, but SAG qua SAG steered clear of controversy. During WWII, SAG saw its ranks depleted as Hollywood actors auditioned for new roles in uniform. By the end of 1942, the guild estimated that more than half its membership was serving in the armed forces. It patriotically rejected any hint of celebrity privilege. When Brigadier Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, head of the Selective Service System, suggested that draft deferments be granted to certain “essential personnel” in the motion picture industry, SAG voted unanimously to remove actors from consideration. “The Screen Actors Guild took no part in requesting that the motion picture industry be classified specially for the draft,” read its resolution. “It believes actors and everyone else in the motion picture industry should be subject to the same rules for the draft as the rest of the country.” SAG emphasized that “no actor is irreplaceable, regardless of his value as a marquee draw and studio business property.” In the postwar era, SAG hoped to continue to avoid politics, but politics had other ideas. In October 1947, the guild was dragged into the spotlight by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Two former SAG Presidents, George Murphy and Robert Montgomery, and the current president, Ronald Reagan, were subpoenaed and testified as friendly witnesses (meaning they agreed that HUAC had a right to investigate Hollywood but vehemently denied that the industry was a hotbed of communism). All three made excellent impressions and went on to estimable careers in politics: Murphy as US senator from California (1965-71), Montgomery as a media advisor to Dwight Eisenhower (he persuaded Ike to advertise on the new medium of television in his first presidential campaign in 1952), and Reagan, whom you know about . Nonetheless, SAG’s performance during the blacklist era marks the darkest chapter in its history. It did not establish the blacklist — that was the work of the Motion Picture Association of America, whose infamous Waldorf Statement issued on November 25, 1947, committed the studios to firing known communists and denying employment to anyone who refused to say they weren’t — but it facilitated and normalized the operation of the blacklist. In 1948, SAG’s membership voted to approve an anti-communist loyalty oath for guild officers and in 1953 mandated the same for guild membership. Acting in his capacity as SAG president, Reagan served on the board of the Motion Picture Industry Council, a kind of clearing house “to permit those accused of subversive affiliations to explain their connections.” Actors unwilling to explain or recant “subversive affiliations” were not shielded by the guild. In 1951, when the actress Gale Sondergaard petitioned SAG to support her intention to defy HUAC, the guild rebuffed her. “The guild, as a labor union, will fight against any secret blacklist created by any group of employers,” it claimed, but hastened to add: “On the other hand, if any actor by his own actions outside of union activities has so offended American public opinion that he has made himself unsalable at the box office, the Guild cannot force any employer to hire him.” The world was far too dangerous a place for red-blooded American actors to engage in “dialectic fencing.” That is, if Sondergaard or any other actor refused to cooperate with HUAC, they were on their own. Barbara Stanwyck receives her Screen Actors Guild Award from Governor-Elect Ronald Reagan, left, and SAG President Charlton Heston, November 20, 1966. Looking back, historians of Hollywood have rendered a harsh judgment on what David F. Prindle, in his 1988 study The Politics of Glamour: Ideology and Democracy in the Screen Actors Guild , calls “the guild’s cooperation with HUAC, and its acquiescence in the graylists and blacklists.” Yet, as Prindle notes, the guild was dealt a bad hand with no good cards to play. In 1951, when the actor Larry Parks, star of The Jolson Story (1946) and Jolson Sings Again (1949), recanted his past communism in testimony before HUAC, SAG “gave him a clean slate,” but he was too toxic to be rehabilitated. In the end, it was the studios, not the guild, that did the hiring — and firing. SAG’s other postwar crisis was a matter of dollars and cents. When the studios began selling their pre-1948 back catalogs to television, the owners of the films made a fortune, the actors made nothing (just ask the Three Stooges). Increasingly — and indeed down to the present day — SAG has devoted its energies to gaining for its membership a slice of the revenue streams opened up by new technologies, what guild negotiators call “just compensation.” Jurisdictional squabbles with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represented over-the-air performers on broadcast media, complicated matters. An actor working on two screens — live TV in New York and film in Hollywood — had to belong to two unions and pay two sets of dues. The double dipping was resolved in 2012, when the two unions merged, with SAG retaining billing for the annual awards ceremony, but the ads and stationery saying “SAG-AFTRA ONE UNION.” Though it was like getting blood from a stone, SAG eventually secured residual payments for network shows and films broadcast on television, usually on a sliding scale depending on whether the show were re-broadcast in prime time or circulated in syndication. Not until 1974 however did SAG broker a landmark deal that secured payments “in perpetuity” for re-run film and tv performances. No longer, as SAG executive secretary Chester L. Midgen remarked, would actors be doing “benefit performances for the stations and advertisers.” Any capitulation from the owners came after hard bargaining and, on three occasions, strikes: in 1960 (over television), 2000 (commercials), and 2023 (streaming). Alas, the cash windfall in network television residuals (just ask the cast of Friends ) has not flowed from other residual streams. The financial rewards accrued from streaming and downloading have been parsimonious. On social media, actors take a perverse delight in posting pictures of residual payments for amounts lower than the postage needed to mail the check. Today, SAG confronts challenges as urgent as any in its history from a new breed of financial buccaneers and mercenary intelligences human and artificial. To remove the guild label from its awards ceremony is a decision that, as Eddie Cantor might put it, seems screwy.

Getty Images Stop me if you’ve heard this before: A big media merger may cause a major reset of the TV studio business. It happened after Disney acquired Fox’s studio assets. It happened both before and after the Skydance- Paramount merger. Now, with Paramount poised to take control of Warner Bros. Discovery , it could happen again with two of the most prolific TV studio operations in the industry. Including co-productions, Warner Bros. Television Group’s various production units and Paramount’s studios together have more than 100 series currently airing or about to premiere and another 25 to 30 more either greenlit for future dates or in development. The studios’ output touches almost every part of the TV landscape, from streaming to broadcast syndication, and includes shows ranging from Euphoria to Dora . Related Stories TV Longtime CBS News Producer Cites Claims of Aiming Reporting Towards \"Particular Part of the Political Spectrum\" in Exit Memo Business What Sparked Paramount's Investigation of Jeff Shell The Warner Bros. Discovery board approved the deal Friday, but the merger still faces a potentially rocky path to regulatory approval, both domestically and abroad (Paramount is targeting the third quarter of this year for closing the deal). Assuming it clears all those hurdles, the combined TV studio operations would be a behemoth, easily outpacing the volume of any other studio. (That’s aside from the potentially awkward combination of streaming platforms, FAST channels and cable outlets the merged company will boast.) That also assumes, of course, that the combined studio colossus will keep making that many shows, and that Warner Bros. Television, Paramount TV Studios, CBS Studios and their various subunits will keep going as currently constituted. In short, that’s unlikely. For starters, Paramount will come out of the deal with tens of billions of dollars in debt on its books. The company laid off more than 1,000 employees after the (much smaller) Skydance merger, and it would be foolish to think that more aren’t coming should the WBD merger close. The combined Paramount-WBD under David Ellison will doubtless look for “efficiencies” (i.e., cost cuts via layoffs and buyouts) across the TV studio spectrum. The debt load could also “change the calculus about how content is monetized downstream,” analyst Julie Clark, senior vp media and entertainment at TransUnion, told The Hollywood Reporter . “It will hinge some on the consolidation of their tech and how they connect with audiences and advertisers with the core IP that they have.” The deal will result in a trove of household name-level properties residing under the Paramount umbrella. In addition to its own brands, which include Star Trek, SpongeBob and the just-revived G.I. Joe franchise, Paramount will eventually have control of Warner properties DC Studios, the Harry Potter franchise — an HBO series based on the books is due to premiere in 2027 — and the Godzilla/Kong Monsterverse, which WB produces with Legendary Pictures, among others. Without an in-house broadcast network and with WBD’s non-HBO cable channels mostly out of the scripted TV business, Warner Bros. TV has been the largest seller of programming to other outlets in recent years. In addition to HBO and streamer HBO Max, the studio has series currently running or in the works at Netflix, Apple TV, Hulu, Prime Video and all of the big four broadcast networks — including CBS, which will become a corporate sibling after the merger closes. In its first public statement after the WBD board approved the deal Friday, Paramount said the combined company will operate the Paramount and Warner Bros. movie studios independently, and that it will continue buying from and selling to third parties. “I think ultimately, it will be a similar kind of volume” coming from the two studios, Clark said. “My guess is that windowing will become more important, especially for premium IP.” Paramount’s statement did not, however, mention any specific plans for how the TV studios will operate — but recent history suggests a shakeup is on the horizon. After the Disney-Fox merger in 2019, the TV studio operations underwent several reorganizations. Four studios (ABC Studios, ABC Signature, 20th Television and Fox 21) just after the merger were winnowed to just one , 20th TV, by October 2024. Paramount’s saga is even odder: It shuttered Paramount TV Studios in August 2024 as a cost-cutting move in anticipation of the Skydance merger; its productions moved to CBS Studios. A year later, as that deal was about to close, the company revived PTVS , reclaiming its previous shows and folding in those from Showtime/MTV Entertainment — which went by the wayside post-merger — and those of the formerly independent Skydance TV. Details on any possible reorganization may not emerge for months, as Paramount will have to be circumspect in its public comments until the deal fully closes. In the meantime, both companies’ sets of TV production units will continue their business under that cloud of uncertainty. THR"

The court had just dismissed claims against MRC’s insurer over a nine-figure payout in connection with the sixth season of the show for the second time. There would be another bite at the apple but not a fourth, the judge overseeing the case warned. MRC needed a new legal strategy. Enter Kevin Spacey , who was on the hook for over $31 million to MRC for breaching his contract by violating anti-harassment policies. There was some bad blood between the two sides, but Spacey had something the production company desperately needed in its case against insurer Fireman’s Fund: the star’s cooperation. Until that point, the court just wasn’t buying arguments that the actor was too sick to film. It was a major problem, one MRC likely couldn’t solve without Spacey in its effort to claw back some money from House of Cards ‘ disastrous final season. Related Stories Movies Hillary Clinton, Widow of Renée Good Attend Berlin's Cinema for Peace Gala as Kaouther Ben Hania Leaves Award Behind General News From Glastonbury to (No Longer) Prince Andrew: The Entertainment Scandals That Rocked Britain in 2025 So the production company ended up striking a deal for him to turn state’s witness. In exchange for reducing the arbitration award to a paltry $1 million, Spacey agreed to turn over his medical records and provide a court declaration that he may have killed himself if he had to return for the final season of the show (further details are sealed). That admission changed the nature of the case. And now, a trial is underway that will decide whether MRC is owed upward of $100 million. The question at the center of the case: What actually killed Spacey’s appearance from the sixth season of the show? If you ask MRC, it’s because of the actor’s sex addiction, which it maintains is a sickness that led to his unavailability after he checked himself into a luxe Arizona rehab facility. But if you ask Fireman’s Fund, it’s because of media fallout in response to allegations of sexual assault. A win for MRC will have major implications for production insurance coverage moving forward. Under the policy, MRC was covered for losses in connection with a “sickness,” which wasn’t all that defined under the terms of the contract and will be a major focus of the trial. MRC had already produced five seasons of House of Cards starring Spacey, who by the end of the fifth seasons was President of the United States and running for re-election. And by the time the allegations against him surfaced, the first two episodes of the sixth had already been shot. The timeline is important. To rewind: A BuzzFeed report published on Oct. 29, 2017 detailed alleged sexual abuse and assault by Spacey across several decades. It was an all hands-on-deck situation for MRC, which put the production on hiatus two days later. And on Nov. 2, CNN published a report accusing Spacey of sexual assault, this time involving crew members. With the blast radius of the allegations spreading, the actor checked himself into The Meadows, a $28,000-a-month rehab facility, that same day. At that point, MRC was operating under the belief that Spacey would be incapable of appearing for the sixth season and announced his suspension the next day. But here’s where a chunk of the controversy arises. Spacey’s lawyer, Todd Rubenstein, told the production company on Nov. 4 that the actor was “available, willing and able to provide all of the services” required under his contract. That clashed with an earlier assertion from his agent, Matt DelPiano, to MRC CEO Scott Tenley a couple days earlier that Spacey was “sick” and going away for a “very long time,” at least six months. Ultimately, MRC scrapped the existing script and created an entirely new story arc, writing Spacey’s character out of the show completely. How much weight will jurors give to Rubenstein’s posture that Spacey would leave rehab to film if MRC asked? We’ll see, but any good entertainment lawyer would’ve said the same to preserve their clients’ rights in this kind of situation, especially when there’s a pay-or-play obligation. Tenley certainly didn’t believe it. “Charitably, I believed [Rubenstein] was simply taking a legal position,” he said in a deposition. In the trial, Fireman’s Fund will argue that MRC’s suspension of Spacey was a business decision. This is where Netflix comes into the fold. Under the distribution deal, it had what’s called “tiebreaker” rights over the scripts, storyline and casting. Netflix is alleged to have exercised those rights on Nov. 3 in the wake of the CNN report, with the company also declining to release Spacey starring-vehicle Gore around that time, per court filings. Fireman’s Fund says that the company threatened not to air new episodes of House of Cards if MRC stuck with Spacey, who was suspended later that evening. Indeed, Pauline Micelli, MRC’s former president of TV Legal and Business Affairs, testified that the tiebreaker rights had “everything to do with” the removal of Spacey’s character. MRC, however, maintains Netflix never exercised those rights. Tenley in a deposition owned up to that decision, at one point answering in the affirmative when asked whether Spacey was a “monster with respect to the people he had victimized” and pointing to an unspecified complaint against the actor during the first season of the series. One question jurors may have to weigh is whether Netflix effectively exercised its tiebreaker rights by threatening not to distribute new episodes even though it might not have formally exercised them. If so, they’ll probably buy arguments from Fireman’s Fund that Spacey wasn’t suspended because of any “sickness” but rather the potential blowback to allowing him to stay on. During the trial, Spacey is expected to admit that he wasn’t able to work when the sexual assault allegations first surfaced despite his statements to the contrary in the immediate aftermath of the situation. He’ll likely testify that his illness required continued treatment. MRC has advanced a plethora of evidence it says demonstrates that Spacey couldn’t and shouldn’t have returned to the set during that period of his life. That leads to what is essentially the hardest question the jury will face: Are MRC’s losses from the sixth season of the show directly linked to Spacey’s illness? The policy states that any loss must be “solely” caused by the sickness. That may sound like a winning issue for Fireman’s Fund, but courts have recognized that a condition can cause the problematic behavior at the core of an insurance dispute. Consider a hypothetical insurance dispute involving Bruce Willis, who continued acting as his dementia got worse. If he was found in breach of his contract after forgetting lines or behaving inappropriately, it could be argued that his poor performance was the cause of that breach. An equally strong argument could be made that the dementia was the real cause because his actions are manifestations of his condition. That’s essentially what MRC is arguing here: Spacey’s conduct, his need for treatment and the risk he posed if he continued filming the sixth season were all direct results of his sickness. Spacey taking the stand will grab the headlines, but a win for MRC on this point could have insurers scrambling to rework the fine print. After all, why should they carry all the risk of a production casting an actor with a history of sexual misconduct when it can just claim that any losses are due to a sex addiction? THR"

Wesley Mann Logo text The timing was almost too conspicuous. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos had just flown to Washington, D.C. to attend meetings at the White House, likely to gauge the temperature on just what regulatory hurdles the company would encounter to acquire Warner Bros. He faced a bet-the-company decision. Paramount had raised its bid, dethroning Netflix in the jockeying for the fabled studio. Sarandos had days to decide whether to counter. Instead, just hours after he was pictured departing the White House, he dropped out of the bidding war. Paramount had won. Now, all eyes turn to two people: Makan Delrahim, a savvy legal operator who’s familiar with the ins-and-outs of D.C. dealmaking and is the architect of Paramount’s merger blueprint, and Rob Bonta, California’s top prosecutor who will likely lead the effort among state attorneys general to block the deal. Expect a court face-off that will shape the landscape of Hollywood for years to come. Related Stories TV Longtime CBS News Producer Cites Claims of Aiming Reporting Towards \"Particular Part of the Political Spectrum\" in Exit Memo Business What Sparked Paramount's Investigation of Jeff Shell On Thursday, amid speculation that the government will rubber stamp the deal for its favored bidder, Bonta planted his flag over the merger. “Paramount/Warner Bros. is not a done deal,” he said in a statement. “These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.” Bonta said he’s in talks with other attorneys general about the acquisition. Still, they’re starting behind the eight ball. Paramount filed for approval of the deal last year and has already submitted the necessary information to the Justice Department, an atypical maneuver meant to put the federal government and states on a time crunch. Such compliance with this regulatory requirement in normal circumstances can take over a year, but Paramount got it done in a couple of months. It’s now a race against the clock. Paramount will likely look to close the deal as soon as it gets approval from foreign regulators. A lawsuit can be filed after the merger is consummated, but the playing field will look different at that point. In that scenario, Paramount would have started to integrate Warner Bros. into its operations. Courts have historically been more open to stopping a deal rather than unwinding one. The upshot: Time is a big consideration right now, and it’s largely on Paramount’s side. To buy some, California could seek a temporary court order blocking Paramount from closing. Everything is on the table from the types of arguments made to the relief sought, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. “It’s all well and good they got past the federal government, but they haven’t gotten past California,” this insider in the state government says. “They can’t short circuit our investigation or concerns here.” Timing aside, state attorneys general, particularly Bonta, appear confident they can advance a compelling narrative that the merger violates antitrust laws. A Sherman Act claim, which blocks deals that entrench an existing monopoly, is almost surely off the table, but the argument that the merger violates the Clayton Act, which blocks deals that will create a monopoly, could be almost as strong, if not stronger in some areas. The story they can tell: The acquisition will shrink the playing field from five major studios to four and bring together two major newsrooms . And unlike the Netflix deal, there are horizontal issues since Paramount and Warner Bros. compete against each other in cable TV, news and sports. An under-discussed possibility involves centering the case around a could-be monopsony, a dynamic in which a buyer with outsize market power can purchase labor and goods at prices under market value. Talent in Hollywood have been sounding the alarm on this issue for years. “Media consolidation has made it exponentially more difficult to sell a television or movie project,” wrote Leonard Dick, a writer on Lost and House , to the Federal Trade Commission in 2023. “If I am partnered with say, 20th Television (owned by Disney) and the Disney-owned streamer/networks don’t want to order it, chances are slim to none another network/streamer will buy it because they want to own their own shows.” Dan Gregor, a writer on How I Met Your Mother , echoed those concerns, telling the FTC that he has “zero leverage to negotiate now.” In a post on X on Friday, Mark Ruffalo urged state attorneys general to come together to talk with talent about how the deal will “kill competition in the industry and drive down wages.” He urged people to weigh in on the merger here . “We are looking at this from all sides, including horizontal consolidation and certainly any vertical impacts,” said the person familiar with Bonta’s thinking, who noted that the deal’s impact on labor is a “significant concern.” Theatrical releases may also factor into the case. Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox could be instructive. After the merger, the studio’s output plunged from 14 movies in each of 2017 and 2018 to a combined 19 from 2023 to 2025. Paramount CEO David Ellison has pledged to release at least 30 movies per year. Can he follow through on that promise? Maybe in the short-term, but it’s tough to make the math work on that commitment farther out. One consideration for Paramount will be the court that oversees the potential merger challenge. The Central District of California, where the lawsuit will likely be filed, has its share of conservative judges, but not to the degree of, let’s say, the Northern District of Texas, where the president filed his 60 Minutes lawsuit. Political considerations will take a backseat in the case, but it’s almost impossible to ignore. If the case is a coin flip, that could be the tiebreaker. “A five-to-four merger in the cardboard market would be viewed differently than in this context with these companies that will have control over most major news outlets,” says Rebecca Allen, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt law school. Syracuse University Professor J. Chrisopher Hamilton, who’s worked as a business exec and lawyer for the Paramount Global, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery , stresses the “sheer scope of narrative control” the merger will bring. “We are talking about HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Turner Classic Movies, and a vast universe of cable networks that shape how tens of millions of Americans consume not just news, but culture, history, and storytelling itself,” he says. “When you control the news division and the entertainment pipeline simultaneously, under the same ideological constraints, you don’t just control what people are told, you control what they imagine, what they aspire to, and what they believe is normal.” Consumers present another roadblock. Earlier this month, they filed a lawsuit looking to block Netflix’s bid to acquire Warner Bros and could do the same against Paramount. They’re not as well-resourced as the federal government or state attorneys general and are widely perceived as doomed to fail, but there’s been some success on this front. In 2021, a federal appeals court affirmed a decision requiring a company in the door manufacturing industry to divest certain assets. For Delrahim, his thinking could be geared not so much toward whether the deal will get done but rather what Paramount will have to concede. Competition enforcers under President Donald Trump have reverted to accepting settlements to resolve concerns about mergers. If the Justice Department sues, it could be an avenue for him to shape the ideology of the content the company creates. Overseas, don’t expect European regulators to lodge an aggressive challenge to the deal either. Historically, their focus has largely revolved around local fixes aimed at requiring companies to sell off certain cable/TV assets in certain territories where there’s not much competition. The European Commission approved the purchase of 21st Century Fox in 2019 after Disney agreed to divest from several European factual TV channels, including History and Lifetime, since they overlapped with Fox’s National Geographic channels. And in what could be a closer analogue to the Paramount-Warner Bros. deal, Amazon’s 2022 purchase of MGM was greenlit without any conditions. Big picture concerns of streaming consolidation and theatrical releases fell by the wayside in both of these instances. Regardless of legal considerations, Ellison will have to deal with have to navigate the practical realities of carrying nearly $100 billion in debt. He’s planning $6 billion in cost savings but that figure could quickly balloon to multiple times that amount, as Sarandos said it would. THR"

Paramount Pictures Logo text The good news continues for the new regime at Paramount as Scream 7 blows past all expectations at the domestic box office , where the Spyglass Media pic is on course to open to $60 million or more, a franchise-best and the year’s biggest launch to date. It even has shot at $65 million, which would be the best opening in months. Friday’s haul of $28.8 million includes $7.8 million in Thursday previews, which began just as David Ellison’s Paramount-Skydance learned the path has been cleared for the company to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that has left Hollywood rocked to its core after Netflix stepped away . The merger — which would mark be biggest leveraged buyout in history — is bittersweet for many since it will see the number of legacy Hollywood studios dwindle from five to four and result in massive layoffs across film, television and corporate operations. Related Stories TV Longtime CBS News Producer Cites Claims of Aiming Reporting Towards \"Particular Part of the Political Spectrum\" in Exit Memo Business What Sparked Paramount's Investigation of Jeff Shell Back to Scream 7 . The droves of moviegoers rushing to see the picproves once again why many genres titles are generally review-proof. The pic — whose major coup was getting Neve Campbell to return after sitting out the last installment — currently sits at a series-worst 33 percent critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes , but its RT audience score is a good-enough 78 percent (studios generally want to see 80 percent and above). And it earned a B- CinemaScore; its predecessors all earned some variation of B, which is a high grade for a horror title. Co-financed by Spyglass Media and Paramount, the film is playing in 3,540 theaters in North America. Overseas, it is rolling out in 52 markets, including Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom, with seven additional markets to follow. (The series does best in English-speaking markets.) Globally, Scream 7 is now targeting targeting a launch north of $80 million. While Paramount’s new studio heads Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein inherited the Spyglass project, they, along with newly installed marketing head Josh Goldstine successfully carried it over the finish line. Spyglass fully produced the movie, with Paramount co-financing half of the net $45 million budget. Heading into the weekend, Paramount was forecasting a $40 million launch for the slasher pic , which would have still marked the best three-day launch of the year to date. Tracking was more bullish, with the National Research Group projecting $45 million. As of now, Scream VI , which launched to $44.4 million in March 2023, is the record-holder for the series’ top opener, not adjusted for inflation. Scream 7 has another secret weapon in its arsenal — it will be the first installment to play in Imax . It is also playing across all other premium formats. Combined, they are ponying up 40 percent of the grosses. Imax doesn’t generally turn over its entire footprint to a horror title, but the 2026 pipeline to date has been relatively sparse when it comes to event studio product. Kevin Williamson, who wrote the script for the original Scream , Scream 2 and Scream 4 , directs the seventh installment. The story follows Sidney (Campbell) as she returns to a small town with her daughter (Isabel May), only to soon cross paths with a new Ghostface killer. The girl is named Tatum, the same name of Rose McGowan’s character in the 1996’s Scream who was murdered. A trailer released in October focused on Ghostface targeting Sidney and Tatum, with Sidney teaching her daughter the rules of surviving the brutal killer. Another ad played during the Super Bowl , underscoring how important the franchise is to the new regime at Paramount. In addition to Campbell, original star Courteney Cox returns as reporter Gale Weathers. While Campbell’s return marks a highly anticipated moment for fans, two stars of the revival films Scream (2022) and Scream VI will not be back. Melissa Barrera was fired from Scream 7 because of her social media posts about the Israel-Hamas war. Jenna Ortega had already left the film voluntarily before the firing, though it was not made public until after. Christopher Landon, who was set to direct the horror sequel, also exited amid intense fan backlash after Barrera’s firing, despite not being the one to fire the actress. Other franchise stars returning include David Arquette as Dewey Riley, completing the legacy trio alongside Sidney and Gale. Matthew Lillard, one of the original co-Ghostface killers, is coming back as Stu Macher, as well as Scott Foley, Scream 3 ‘s Ghostface Roman Bridger — Sidney’s half-brother. Siblings Chad and Mindy, played by Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown are also in Scream 7. The other big victor of the weekend is Neon and Baz Luhrmann ‘s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert , which looks to stay in the top 10 as it expands nationwide after getting off to a rousing start last weekend in its imited debut in 325 Imax screens after earning glowing marks from both critics and audiences. And on Friday, it earned a coveted A+ CinemaScore. From Neon, the concert doc took in an estimated $3.3 million domestically to crack the top 10 chart before it expands nationwide. It made an additional $1.1 million in select Imax screens offshore. Luhrmann — who also directed the acclaimed biopic Elvis starring Austin Butler — painstakingly restored 59 hours of unseen footage from the Warner Bros. archives, including discarded material from two ‘70s concert films.and Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley doc, which looks to come in fourth place with a dazzling $7 million start to $8 million start.

Netflix Logo text [This story contains major spoilers from Bridgerton season four, Part 2.] Benedict ( Luke Thompson ) and Sophie ( Yerin Ha ) may have finally found their happily ever after in Bridgerton season four, but it wasn’t without plenty of hurdles and setbacks that come with any fairytale story. In Part 2 alone, while also trying to figure out how to make their relationship work within society — as Sophie is a maid and Benedict is a nobleman — Sophie is also dealing with Araminta’s (Katie Leung) vendetta against her, trying to throw her in prison forever, and Benedict is contemplating leaving his family and society so he can be with his one true love. Related Stories Business Paramount Pays Out $2.8 Billion Termination Fee to Netflix as Warner Deal Draws Near General News Who Won and Lost the Week: The Great Netflix Pull-Out Edition (Plus Tyra, Shia and More) But thanks to Lady Violet Bridgerton’s (Ruth Gemmell) masterful plan, Benedict and Sophie make it down the aisle legally (if you caught that post-credits scene) by the end, along with a few highly anticipated spicy scenes along the way. Thompson tells The Hollywood Reporter that it was important for them to “deliver something real” for Benedict and Sophie’s intimate scenes, “because we’re not thirst trap puppets.” Below, Thompson and Ha break down Part 2, including the chaos with Araminta (Katie Leung), filming those spicy scenes and their thoughts on the new Lady Whistledown mystery. *** This season centers on a love story between two people who wouldn’t be accepted by society’s views. What did you love most about bringing this type of love story to the show in a Cinderella-esque way? LUKE THOMPSON I love how the tensions of what can and can’t happen, both because of internal and external blocks, really undoes Benedict. From my point of view, it was really nice to watch a character like that get completely torn to pieces a little bit. I think that’s fun. It’s a nice thing to experience from an actor’s point of view. YERIN HA And how much your character can change you internally, and make you really face your internal obstacles and actually have to deal with them. That was really fun to play. Yerin Ha and Luke Thompson in season four. Netflix Benedict was really going through it in Part 2, between trying to decide if he’s going to leave his family and move to the countryside with Sophie or figure out another way. What was your reaction when you first read that Benedict was willing to lose his family for love? Did you agree? THOMPSON It’s not really about agreeing with it or not. Symbolically, you always have to hold onto your family a little less tightly if you’re going to begin a family with someone else. That’s what’s quite poignant about that relationship, that meeting someone is your little doorway out of the family unit. And it’s particularly poignant with a family united by grief, by losing the dad. Everyone’s held onto each other a little bit more closely, and Benedict particularly. Everyone’s reacted to that differently, but Benedict’s response seems to have been to become some sort of glue to the family and keeping them very close. That’s the journey, isn’t it? You have to learn to let go a little bit if you’re going to change and start a story with someone else. It was also really intense when Araminta had Sophie arrested and thrown in a jail cell, and almost put on trial. What was it like filming those more intense scenes in Part 2? HA We’ve never seen a Bridgeton jail before. I was like, “How dark are we going?” I really did have to lean on the directors, and when you are working with a great script and a great cast member like Katie, who really does make you feel immense fear, I think you’re just able to play on the day,. It’s fun to play those scenes and explore that part of Sophie, and to go deep into that narrative that we’ve never really seen Bridgeton tackle before. There are also more intimate scenes in Part 2, including the bathtub scene from the book. How did you work with the intimacy coordinator to bring those scenes to life? HA A lot of choreography. There were so many logistical things we had to contend with and problem-solve, from slippery, oily water to a long bathtub for a 5-foot-2 girl to twisting and turning away ( laughs ). It was genuinely like choreography. And actually, when you have those logistical things that you have to overcome, it’s kind of more fun. THOMPSON Seven hours in a bathtub … it’s not for the faint-hearted ( laughs ). HA [You become] a prune. THOMPSON With those scenes, the thing to really hold at bay, for me anyway, is that sort of pressure of, Oh, it’s this kind of scene and we need to deliver this kind of thing so that people need to be excited or whatever . I think that’s not really your job. Your job is to just live the scene. Lizzy [Talbot], the intimacy coordinator, enables you to do that. She puts you straight in the scene rather than standing there thinking, Are people going to enjoy this? You can’t really control that, so you have to keep that side of things at bay because we’re not thirst trap puppets. We try and deliver something real, the story of it. Luke Thompson and Yerin Ha in season four. Netflix In the end, Sophie and Benedict thankfully end up together, but even if Araminta didn’t agree to Violet’s plan, do you think the Queen would have potentially let Benedict marry a maid? THOMPSON I like the narrative beat that there is a little fudge on the truth because it’s nice in the same way that Benedict, through being with Sophie, has found his weight, his seriousness and being in touch with reality. I think it’s nice that Sophie retains this little secret, this little bit of fantasy with that fudge on the truth at the end. The symmetry of that. But it wouldn’t be a good ending, wouldn’t it? HA I like to think for the happy ending sake that she would still say yes. Also, there’s a new mystery Lady Whistledown. Who do each of you think it is? HA No clue. It really could be anyone. THOMPSON It could be anyone. All bets are off. I don’t have any inkling at all. I think they’ve written it specifically for that, because we only get a little taste of this new voice until we get further on into the next season. Though season five won’t be focused on Benedict and Sophie, what do you hope for your characters next season, post-wedding? THOMPSON I don’t know. We’ll see. That’s beyond my pay grade. It’d be nice to see them have kids, and just be a part of the family as well. They’re actually both characters who have nice hotlines to all of the characters in the show, so I hope they still communicate with the siblings. HA Or feel like they can lean on either one of us. *** All episodes of Bridgerton season four are currently streaming on Netflix .

She didn’t wake up on purpose,” Notaro recalls on the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast . “And there I am, snoozing, next to her, with my earplugs in, my eye mask on, my CPAP machine tubes coming out of my head.” Related Stories Anil Kapoor Action-Drama 'Subedaar' Sets Prime Video Bow, Unveils Teaser (EXCLUSIVE) Prime Video Drops Italian Original Film 'Love Me Love Me' Based on Wattpad Book That 'Garnered 24 Million Reads,' Producers Discuss YA Romance Trend (EXCLUSIVE) The nomination was for the film she produced, “ Come See Me in the Good Light ,” a documentary directed by Ryan White that follows the late poet Andrea Gibson (they/them) and her wife, Meg, as they navigate love, illness, and art. Notaro is one of the Oscar-nominated producers on the film alongside Jessica Hargrave and Stef Willen, but she speaks about the work the way she speaks about her real-life friendship with Gibson: something you show up for, repeatedly, always. The writer, director and comedian’s self-mythology has never been about trying portray sainthood or a “perfect picture.” It’s about telling the truth with a straight face and letting the punch line do the damage. When jokingly asked if the nomination had transformed her into an unbearable awards-season creature, she didn’t hesitate. “I’ve always been insufferable, but this just gives me a reason for it all to make sense,” she deadpanned. Popular on Variety That’s the Notaro method. She’ll bring chuckles to the moment and then reveal the feeling underneath. She’ll joke about being “insufferable,” then, minutes later, describe a documentary process so carefully protected that it feels like a mission statement you wish were the standard for everyone in this world. “This project has to be led fully by love and patience,” she shares. “There can’t be a weirdo rattling around in the production. It has to be all, all good.” It’s also, quietly, an explanation for why “Come See Me in the Good Light” lands the way it does, like a hand on the back, offering comfort, and not a finger in the wound. “There are sad moments, but there are also deeply funny moments that surprise people,” she says. “There’s a common vibe at the end of the movie, when people exit the theater — they’re so thankful, saying, ‘Thank you so much for making this movie.’ And there’s a sense of urgency that people feel to get back into life, do things right, and be more present. It fills people with a sense of hope.” That hope is sincere, and not performative. Notaro came to the film with a documentary fan’s devotion and a friend’s responsibility — and, at least at first, with almost no awareness of the machinery that would soon swallow her calendar whole. Her relationship to awards culture, she admitted, used to be blissfully nonexistent. “None, zero,” she quips when asked how familiar she was with the Oscar race. “I remember friends saying, ‘Oh, I’ll have more time after award season.’ I was like, ‘Award season? What is that?’ Now I’m like, full-blown in award season — it’s no joke.” “When we made this film, it was independently financed,” she says. “Getting this movie made about my scrappy poet friend in the mountains of Colorado, and then winning audience favorite at Sundance, selling to Apple — that was just mind-blowing.” But “Come See Me in the Good Light” isn’t simply a documentary that got made. It’s a documentary that chose its own ending — or, more accurately, refused the ending viewers expect from stories about terminal illness. Notaro notes that the decision was made by Gibson or Meg, but by filmmaker Ryan White and the team, who considered both the story and the timing. “Ryan came to everybody and said, ‘Why do we need our hero to die?’” she recalls. “If we wrapped it up and submitted it to Sundance, then if it gets in, Andrea could see the film — because Andrea didn’t think that they were ever going to be able to see the movie.” The team didn’t even tell Gibson or Meg they were submitting, Notaro said, so there wouldn’t be added disappointment if Sundance didn’t come through. When it did, the news landed with shock and sweetness. “What was so beautiful was when the film wrapped, the crew continued to fly out to visit them,” Notaro says. Notaro is blunt about the emotional trick grief can play — the one where you start believing your favorite outcome because you need it to be true. She knows that impulse. She also knows what it means to live on the other side of cancer. Notaro had cancer in 2012 and has spent years around people who look “healthy” until they’re suddenly gone. Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley in “Come See Me in the Good Light.” Apple TV+ Still, she found herself caught off guard by how quickly Gibson died. “I will say, what is hard now is reflecting on the disappointment I have in myself, and I can’t believe I fell for it,” Notaro shares. “I did not believe Andrea would be gone as quickly as they were.” Part of what seduced her, she said, was Gibson’s visible fight — including the footage of Gibson lifting weights while living with stage 4 ovarian cancer. “You know what blows me away in the movie, too, is watching Andrea work out every day,” Notaro says. “That’s somebody with hope, and that is incredible to watch somebody pumping iron with stage four cancer.” She further says, “I honestly thought we were going to make this movie, we’re going to put it out, people are going to be blown away, learn all about Andrea Gibson on a wider level, and Andrea is going to have another five to 10 years to be the rock star in the poetry world that they were.” That sentence contains an entire alternate timeline, and the quiet ache of losing it. Still, the Oscar nomination feels like a coronation to outsiders and a testament to a great person. “Every time I would see Andrea perform intense poetry, but there was also so much light-hearted, funny coming out of that mouth,” Notaro reflects. She talked about “the lines on Andrea’s face, whenever they smiled … it was just exquisite to look at” — and how the laughter, after the performances, became the real intimacy. “There’s depth, but there was nothing better than kicking back and laughing.” Notaro holds onto the love.

Getty Images Updated at 7.55 am.PT… with deaths, TV coverage, Dubai hotel hit and reaction : The U.S. and Israel launched air strikes on Iran on Saturday, following a video statement from President Donald Trump in which he announced “major combat operations” were underway. The military action, dubbed Operation Epic Fury, began with blasts being heard around the Iran’s capital city around 9.30 am local time on Saturday morning, with reports of people running in the streets in panic. There were also strikes on military sites in Kermanshah, Qum, Isfahan, Tabriz, Karaj and Kenarak. Iran state news agency reported 57 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a girls school in Southern Iran, and another 60 wounded.

There were also reports of blasts in Saudi Arabia’s capital of Riyadh, Jordan and Iraq. Watch on Deadline News broke around 7pm local time in Dubai (7am PT) that the Fairmont Hotel in the Emirati city’s Palm Jumeirah district, a neighbourhood popular with expats and tourists, had been hit by falling debris from an intercepted missile and was on fire. The Dubai Media Office issued a statement around 7.50 pm local time confirming an incident in the Palm Jumeirah area, saying the resulting fire was under control with four individuals having sustained injuries. In a separate earlier incident, Emirati-state news agency reported one person had been killed in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, after debris fell on a residential area. Aside from military installations, U.S. and Iran targets included Iran’s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, with seven missiles hitting the area near his presidential palace and compound. Khamenei has been Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, succeeding the Islamic Republic’s late founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A clutch of Israeli media outlets claimed that Khamenei had been killed but Iranian authorities countered these reports saying he was alive and would be addressing the nation. His whereabouts is unknown. Trump announced the operations in an eight-minute video statement, released in the early hours of the U.S. East Coast morning, in which he said the aim was “to crush’ Iran’s military and “eliminate its nuclear program” as well as bring about a change in government. “Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,” he said. “Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas and our allies throughout the world.” (read full speech below). pic.twitter.com/BZuJDudLej — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2026 The U.S. president also called on the Iranian people, who have been subjected to a harsh crackdown against pro-democracy protests in recent weeks, to seize the moment once the bombs have stopped falling to bring about regime change. “To the great, proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere,” he said. “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond.” TV Networks Scramble TV and radio networks worldwide scrambled to get on board the story , breaking into normal programming as a chaotic picture of the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran and Iranian retaliation across the Gulf started to take shape. In a note, NBC News said it put out breaking news on NBC News NOW at 1:44 am ET, followed by a network report at 1:50 am ET, with Jessica Layton anchoring. It has been providing rolling coverage ever since on network and NOW with Peter Alexander taking over anchoring after Trump’s speech around 5 am ET, and joined by Saturday TODAY co-anchor Laura Jarrett at 6 am ET. Coverage over the morning included an exclusive live interview with the Iranian Foreign Minister. Laura Jarrett, Peter Alexander and Kristen Welker on NBC News Special report NBC News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also issued a statement on Saturday, saying that the aim was to remove the Islamic Republic regime from power. The operation “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,” he said. “The time has come for all sections of the people in Iran… to remove the yoke of tyranny… and bring a free and peace-loving Iran,” he added. The military operations follow in the wake of a massive building up since mid-January of the largest force of U.S. warships and aircraft in the Middle East in decades, as Trump tried to force Iran’s Islamic Regime government to abandon its nuclear program in talks. News of the joint U.S. and Israeli attack has met with concerned reaction at home in the U.S. and from leaders worldwide, amid fears that the conflict will escalate and uncertainty over the longer term future for Iran, whether its hardline Islamic Republic falls or not. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned the fact Trump had triggered military action without consulting the U.S. Congress. “The Constitution is clear: the decision to take this nation to war rests with Congress, and launching large-scale military operations – particularly in the absence of an imminent threat to the United States – raises serious legal and constitutional concerns,” he said in a statement on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting, writing on X: “The ongoing escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s Full Speech On “Major Combat Operations” A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world. For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States, our troops, and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel. In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as US naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lanes. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer. From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained, and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts, and it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous October 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before. Iran is the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I’ll say it again. They can never have a nuclear weapon. That is why, in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime’s nuclear program at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. Again, they wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. They didn’t know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades. They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message. For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs — or roadside bombs, as they are sometimes called — to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon. This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration, and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength, or sophistication. My administration has taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region. Even so — and I do not make this statement lightly — the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this — not for now — we’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way, and we trust that with His help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail. To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces, and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity — or, in the alternative, face certain death. So lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great, proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass. May God bless the brave men and women of America’s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all.

That’s the best opening the 30-year old franchise has ever seen. Definite recommend on PostTrak stands at 61% which is very good for any movie, but it’s lower than the 74% of Scream VI which starred Jenna Ortega and Melissa Barrera. What’s clear, the absence of that duo hasn’t hurt ticket sales. Scream on its old guard of Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox prevails. In Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits, 56% came to the movie because it’s part of a franchise they love, 30% came for the cast. Scream 7 also saw the best opening day/previews for the franchise at $28.8M. Rivals are predicting a mid-$60M opening, but that all depends on whether Saturday can withstand a -20% decline against that $28.8M. Presales were heavy with 53% of the audience buying their tickets within the last week or a week ago. So hopefully, there’s more walk-up today. Scream 7 is propelling the weekend to an estimated $110.3M for all titles, which is +103% over the same weekend a year ago. Watch on Deadline CinemaScore is a B-, which is lower than Scream VI ‘s B+ and on par with 2011’s Scream IV (which was a low point for the franchise; that pic opening to $18.6M and finaling at $38.1M domestic, $97.2M WW). A B+ CinemaScore is the highest ever achieved by any Scream movie and that grade also went to the original 1996 movie, and its 1997 sequel, Scream 2. For Scream VI, it was the 18-24 crowd who were the biggest at 41% and this time it was 25-34 demo at 32%. Hispanic and Latino is slightly lighter this time around at 30% (but still strong) versus Scream VI ‘s 38%. Caucasian was 39%, a much stronger turnout from Black moviegoers at 20% (compared to Scream VI ‘s 12%), with Asian American at 3% (down from VI’s 12%). PLFs and Imax are driving 40% of the weekend with sixthquel playing evenly, everywhere in the country. The Regal Times Square in NYC is the top grossing location with just over $70K through yesterday. There’s a great excitement from rival studios over the movie’s overperformance, one exclaiming “Nostalgia + young = $$$$$$$” while another exclaims there’s a “Neve-aissance” going on with the actress also popping on the Netflix series The Lincoln Lawyer. It’s clear given the young skewing demo, the marketing campaign leaned more on social than linear. iSpot shows only $6M being spent for Scream 7 spots in a very targeted campaign that included NFL, NBA, SportsCenter and Men’s College Basketball. Also, remember Paramount booked that lucrative pre-game Super Bowl spot for Scream 7. Cox gets in on the weekend fun: View this post on Instagram Elsewhere in the top 10, Trafalgar has a Twenty-One Pilots concert movie, Twenty One Pilots: More Than We Ever Imagined – Live in Mexico City. Pic is playing some Imas screens and did an estimated $2.1M on Friday with an eye on $3.6M for the weekend in fourth place at 833 locations. Top performing markets include Salt Lake City, Philly, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tampa, Detroit, Cleveland, Nashville, and more. More.. UPDATED FRIDAY MIDDAY: David Ellison can celebrate another win this weekend in addition to taking pole position with Warner Bros and that’s that Scream 7 is heading to a franchise opening record of $59M after a $28M Friday that includes previews. What the? Nope, no head-scratching needed. Give the Scream fans what they want: Neve Campbell and the franchise’s original architect Kevin Williamson in the director’s chair. Now some rivals are seeing well over $60M for the weekend, but the caution here stems from the front-loadness of horror pics. Previous opening record was 2023’s Scream VI with $44.4M domestic. The Spyglass co-production was put into motion by the previous Paramount Brian Robbins administration, however, the current admin under marketing czar Josh Goldstine takes the win for the franchise opening record. And as an extra bonus today, the PSKY stock is up post following news of Warner Bros’ realizing Paramount’s superior offer with $13.51 at the time of this post, +21%. Given the big opening for Scream 7, the entire weekend looks to be well ahead of the same frame a year ago (Feb. finale/beginning of March) which did $54.4M per Box Office Mojo."

Discovery Stirs Angst At CNN – Again FCC Approves Charter’s Merger With Cox Enterprises The Battle For Warner Bros May Be Over, But Regulatory Scrutiny Of Paramount’s Deal Is Not View All February 28, 2026 8:28am Getty Images Broadcast and cable networks mobilized overnight for ongoing coverage of the U.S. and Israel attack on Iran, in Donald Trump’s most significant military action of his second term. As strikes hit Tehran, U.S. outlets provided a mixture of video from news agencies and those obtained from individuals. As Iran launched retaliatory strikes, correspondents in cities including Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi provided details. On CNN International, an alarm sounded as anchor Becky Anderson, in the UAE, alerted videos that they were told to seek shelter. She immediately went to a commercial break. Related Stories News Paramount Purchase Of Warner Bros. Discovery Stirs Angst At CNN - Again News FCC Approves Charter's Merger With Cox Enterprises “We are all safe,” Anderson later said, confirming retaliatory strikes there and in Bahrain and Qatar, other countries with U.S. military bases. Watch on Deadline On NBC News , weekend Today anchors Peter Alexander and Laura Jarrett interviewed Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, from Tehran, who insisted that “all high ranking officials are alive,” while “we are handling this situation, and everything is fine.” The network cautioned that it had not independently verified the claims. Later, ABC News posted a satellite image of the destruction at the residence of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, targeted in the attack. Israeli media reported that the government there believes he was killed. Networks have been covering the attacks throughout the night. CNN broke in with news during The Story Is with Elex Michaelson , its live show from Los Angeles; Fox News broke into regular coverage at 1:38 a.m. ET, and MS NOW at 1:48 a.m. ET. NBC News started coverage at 1:44 a.m. ET. Unlike last year’s attacks on sites believed to be where Iran was developing nuclear capabilities, President Donald Trump signaled in his announcement of the attacks that the U.S. goals were far greater, including regime change. “I’m talking to people who suggest that while this won’t be a matter of hours, it will be a matter of days, but really it could be up to a matter of weeks as well,” Jennifer Griffin, chief national security correspondent, said on Fox News. The U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees the government’s international broadcasting entities, said that President Donald Trump’s announcement of the military action was being carried across Voice of America. “The brave people of Iran are hearing him — and so are citizens living under oppressive regimes around the world,” the agency said. But it was unclear just how effective that effort to reach Iranians has been, given the agency overall has been drastically scaled back under Kari Lake. She wrote on X that the Persian translation of Trump’s remarks was published on the Persian section of the VOA service. In Iran itself, the BBC reported that there was an internet blackout. Some of the most harrowing images were shared by correspondents on social media, including Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson, who posted on an explosion in Bahrain.

      "full_text": "Skip to main content By Chris Koseluk Plus Icon Chris Koseluk View All February 27, 2026 1:55pm Neil Sedaka Brad Barket/Getty Images Neil Sedaka, the buoyant singer-songwriter and pianist who had No. 1 hits with “Laughter in the Rain,” “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,” “Bad Blood” and, for Captain & Tennille, “Love Will Keep Us Together,” died Friday in Los Angeles. He was 86. “Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather,” his family said in a statement. “A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.” Related Stories TV Bobby J. Brown, Actor on 'The Wire,' Dies at 62 in a Fire General News Elizabeth Snead, Former Hollywood Reporter Contributor, Dies at 74 First teaming with lyricist Howard Greenfield — a neighbor in his Brooklyn apartment building — while still in his teens, Sedaka scored his first hit as a songwriter in 1958 when Connie Francis recorded the duo’s “Stupid Cupid,” a peppy single that rose to No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. They wrote several other hits for Francis, including 1958’s “Fallin'” and “Where the Boys Are,” the theme to the popular 1960 MGM comedy; the latter reached No. 4 in the U.S. and became her signature song. The clean-cut Sedaka quickly cemented his pop stardom with a string of popular tunes that included “Oh! Carol” (No. 9), “Stairway to Heaven” (No. 9), “Run Samson Run” (No. 28), “Calendar Girl” (No. 4), “Little Devil” (No. 11), “Happy Birthday, Sweet Sixteen” (No. 6) and “Next Door to an Angel” (No. 5). Sedaka and Greenfield’s “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,” with a carefree, nonsensical opening — “Do do do, Down dooby doo down down, Comma, comma, down dooby doo down down, Comma, comma, down dooby doo down down” — proved irresistible to teens, enjoying a 14-week run on the singles chart and in the summer of 1962 becoming Sedaka’s first No. 1 hit. “I was the king of the tra-la-las and doo-be-do’s in the ’50s and ’60s,” he told Reuters in 2010. “It had to have a very catchy tune, with a catchy beat that you can dance to.” Between 1958-62, Sedaka and Greenfield would sell 25 million records, with 10 big hits in a row. “First, his songs have clever lyrics and wonderfully infectious tunes,” The New York Times wrote in 1976. “Second, his melodies have just enough soft‐rock and rhythm and blues underpinnings to avoid bonelessness. Third, he leavens the cheeriness with sentimentality more innocent than crass. Fourth, he has remarkable voice — a sweetly mellow, evocative high tenor that shades imperceptibly into falsetto.” Despite all that, Sedaka’s popularity and that of other American pop stars began to wane in the mid-’60s amid the British music invasion. He didn’t release an album for six years as singles including “Sunny,” “The World Through a Tear” and “The Answer to My Prayer” barely made a ripple. When his label opted not to renew his contract in 1966, Sedaka took a break from singing and focused on songwriting. Over the next several years, he teamed with Carole Bayer to write “When Love Comes Knockin’ (at Your Door)” and “The Girl I Left Behind Me,” hits for The Monkees. He and Greenfield also penned tunes for The Cyrkle (“We Had a Good Thing Goin'”) and Davy Jones (“Rainy Jane”). The 5th Dimension landed in the top 20 with “Workin’ on a Groovy Thing,” a tune he wrote with Roger Atkins. The Carpenters, Andy Williams and Shirley Bassey enjoyed success with “Solitaire,” a song Sedaka recorded and wrote with lyricist Phil Cody. When his album releases in 1969 ( Workin’ on a Groovy Thing ) and 1971 ( Emergence ) didn’t generate much excitement, Sedaka moved to England in 1970 to change things up. After a chance meeting with Elton John in 1973, he signed with John’s fledgling label, The Rocket Record Co. The move led to one of the most successful periods in Sedaka’s career. In 1974, Polydor Records released Sedaka’s Back , a collection of songs — some recorded with future members of 10cc — from three albums that had only been released in the U.K. It peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard 200 album chart and gave Sedaka his second No. 1 song when the lilting “Laughter in the Rain,” co-written with Cody, became a stateside sensation. The following year, Sedaka scored again with the Rocket Records release The Hungry Years . It went gold in the U.S. and gave him another No. 1 with “Bad Blood,” featuring John on backing vocals. The LP also featured a new version of “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do”; rearranging it as a ballad, he breathed new life into the song and turned it into another top 10 hit and a Song of the Year nominee. In 1975, Captain & Tennille recorded his “Love Will Keep Us Together” and featured it as the title tune on their debut album. The jubilant tune became the year’s best-selling single and was named Record of the Year at the Grammys. (Toni Tennille gave him nod by ad-libbing “Sedaka is back” in the song’s closing frame.) “The crowning touch was winning the BMI award for Most Performed Song of the Year [for ‘Love Will Keep Us Together’],” Sedaka said in Bruce Pollock’s 1979 book, When Rock Was Young . “It was the dream of a lifetime. I mean, I’d been going to that BMI dinner since I was a kid. I got six awards in one year, including the Most Performed Song of 1975, beating out ‘Rhinestone Cowboy.'” Neil Sedaka during his 1976 NBC special, Neil Sedaka Steppin’ Out . Courtesy Everett Collection Sedaka was born in Brooklyn on March 13, 1939, and raised in the Brighton Beach section of the borough. His father, Mordechai, drove a taxi for 30 years. His mother, Eleanor, took on part-time work in an Abraham & Straus department store to pay for his first piano when he was 9. “My parents told me that when I was an infant, I wouldn’t eat until the radio was playing music,” he said in the 2014 BBC documentary Neil Sedaka: King of Song . In 1947, Sedaka landed a scholarship to Juilliard’s School of Music’s Preparatory Division for Children. “Without blowing my own horn, I have the musical training. I studied many, many years,” Sedaka said in a 2019 interview with The Morning Call newspaper. “Matter of fact, in 1956, Arthur Rubinstein, the great pianist, chose me [to be] on a radio program, and I won as the best New York City high school pianist. I was 16 years old.” Sedaka’s mom wanted him to pursue a career as a classical pianist, but Greenfield, a budding poet, convinced him that they should write pop tunes together. They began working together in October 1952 when Sedaka was 13, and one point, they had written at least one song a day for 500 straight days. In 1956, the pair approached Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, and soon, their songs were being recorded by the likes of The Clovers (“Bring Me Love”), The Cookies (“Passing Time”), LaVern Baker (“I Waited Too Long”) and Clyde McPhatter (“Since You’ve Been Gone”). Meanwhile, Sedaka tried his hand at singing, joining forces with three Lincoln High School classmates to form the Linc-Tones. He went solo in 1957, but not before the group enjoyed some success with “While I Dream,” “I Love My Baby,” “Come Back, Joe” and “Don’t Go Away,” all Sedaka-Greenfield compositions. (The Linc-Tones would evolve into The Tokens, who hit pay dirt in 1961 with “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”) Over the next year, Sedaka released “Laura Lee,” “Ring a Rockin'” and “Oh Delilah,” all written with Greenfield. He didn’t cause much of a stir as a singer, though he performed “Ring a Rockin'” on American Bandstand . The songwriting team fared better, however, and landed a contract with Al Nevins and Don Kirshner at Aldon Music in the Brill Building. Through Aldon, they arrived at the home of Francis, who was in search of a follow-up to “Who’s Sorry Now,” and presented her with a selection of ballads. “They played and they played and they played, and I was really falling asleep,” she said in King of Song . “I said, ‘Fellas, I don’t know how to tell you this, your music is beautiful, but it’s too educated, the kids don’t dig this kind of stuff anymore.'” On a lark, Sedaka played “Stupid Cupid,” which he and Greenfield had written for another act. Francis told them on the spot she wanted it for her next record, and its success put the songwriters on the map. As he and Greenfield continued working with the singer, Sedaka observed her writing in a journal. He wanted a look inside, but she refused, and that inspired him to write “The Diary.” Little Anthony and the Imperials recorded a version, but Sedaka’s take (he also played piano on it) got him a recording contract with Aldon. Sedaka wrote “Oh! Carol” in 1958, drawing the idea for the title from Carole Klein, a girl he had dated at Lincoln. He encouraged her to join him at the Brill Building in Manhattan, the mecca for songwriters, and she did. There, Klein joined forces with her future husband, Gerry Goffin, and as Carole King, she became one of the most influential singer-songwriters of her generation. (“Oh! Carol,” meanwhile, sold 3.5 million records, and he said his life changed when he received his first royalty check from that song, for $42,000.) The year 1959 saw the release of Rock With Sedaka , his first solo album as a recording artist. “The Diary,” its debut single, charted, as did the second release, “I Go Ape.” It also contained Sedaka’s takes on “Fallin’,” “Stupid Cupid” and “Another Sleepless Night,” which Jimmy Clanton turned into a hit the following year. “Howard Greenfield and I mastered the art of the 2 1/2-minute single,” he said. “We could tell a whole story from beginning to end [in that time].” He eventually split with Greenfield and partnered with Cody, and “Laughter in the Rain” marked his big comeback, landing at No. 1 in 1975 in its 16th week on the Billboard Hot 100. “I went from making $30,000 a year to $6 million a year with [that] song,” he said. A five-time Grammy nominee and member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Sedaka would write or co-write 700-plus songs and release more than two dozen studio albums during his career. In 2005, Erik Jackson and Ben H. Winters conceived Breaking Up Is Hard to Do , a stage musical celebrating the songs of Sedaka, Greenfield and Cody. It has been performed in the U.K. and throughout the U.S. Around that time, “(Is This the Way to) Amarillo,” a song he wrote with Greenfield that was first recorded by Tony Christie in the ’70s, became another huge hit for him when it was rereleased. Survivors include his wife, Leba, whom he married in 1962; his children, Dara, a recording artist and vocalist for commercials, and Marc, a TV writer and film editor; and three grandchildren. “I think the reason that my music is so special is it was a combination of show music, pop music, evergreen standards and rock. It’s like me and Phil Cody and Carole Sager and Howie Greenfield — we had a combination of all of those styles,” Sedaka said in his Morning Call chat. “I saw Stevie Wonder not long ago on television and he was asked, ‘Who is your inspiration?’ And he said, ‘Neil Sedaka. They used to call me ‘Whitey’ in Detroit because I liked and played Neil Sedaka records.'” THR"

Getty Images The high-stakes gambler who sparked an internal investigation and filed a whistleblower complaint against Jeff Shell had previously discussed a music reality show with him. R.J. Cipriani co-created and exec produced Roku’s Spanish-language series Serenata De Las Estrellas , in which Latin acts like Ozomatli and Los Lobos perform surprise mini-concerts for fans who’ve gone through tough times. He’d been introduced to Shell via their mutual attorney Patty Glaser, and he’d recently pitched the studio boss on picking up the English-language format of Serenata . Related Stories Business It's a Deal: Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery Unveil $111 Billion Megamerger Business Paramount Stock Spikes on Warner Bros. Takeover as Wall Street Games Out Scenarios After the discussion soured, Cipriani brought claims to the attention of Paramount about Shell. As THR previously revealed , the entertainment mogul is alleged to have improperly disclosed details about the timing, cost and structure of his public company’s $7.7 billion media rights deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, whose parent TKO Group Holdings jumped 10 percent following news of the pact. Notably, Glaser has been both Shell’s attorney as well as counsel representing Cipriani in business pertaining to Serenata , whose English-language version has been shopped as Star Serenade . In the current conflict, Cipriani’s counsel is Steve Aaronoff, who previously worked for Glaser. Glaser is a prominent Hollywood litigator with a formidable reputation. Kim Basinger referred to her as “Ms. Glacier” during the 1990s legal feud over the film Boxing Helena . “I sort of took it as a compliment,” Glaser later recalled . Cipriani and Shell declined to comment. Glaser didn’t respond to an inquiry about her involvement with both parties. The Shell saga has surfaced as Paramount owner David Ellison appears to have succeeded with his $111 billion bid to take outmaneuver Netflix and win control of Warner Bros. Discovery, pending regulatory review. Shell landed atop Paramount after his termination from his last top post as NBC Universal’s CEO over allegations of sexual misconduct with a CNBC correspondent. Ellison has repeatedly been willing to look past reported alleged transgressions in big hires, bringing on John Lasseter to run Skydance Animation and, as THR reported Feb. 27, screenwriter Max Landis to work on a feature for its rebooted G.I. Joe franchise. Both men have made public acknowledgments in response to accusations of sexual misconduct. Cipriani is a larger-than-life character known within and beyond the entertainment business for his exploits as a gambler, connector, instigator and whistleblower. Last year, he took issue with the accuracy and framing of a Mark Wahlberg-produced Amazon docuseries about his fraught entanglement with an international drug kingpin. THR"

The supersized Survivor 50 premiere averaged 5.06 million viewers over its three hours. That’s the biggest same-day audience for Survivor episode since the penultimate episode of season 45 in December 2023. The show also delivered CBS’ best Wednesday night performance since May 2022’s season 42 finale of Survivor . The premiere also posted a 0.95 rating among adults 18-49 (equivalent to about 1.29 million people in that age range) — the best night one showing for Survivor since November 2021 — and a 1.22 rating among adults 25-54 (about 1.53 million viewers in that demo).

The event, now in its seventh year, sprawled across a circus-style big-top tented megalopolis at the Santa Monica Airport — a far cry from its 2019 debut on the Paramount lot but every bit as spectacular. With work from 100 galleries representing artists from around the world, hordes of aficionados poured through the space during the opening of the four-day festival. There was, as usual, a heavy celebrity quotient; this year’s included Timothy Olyphant, Emma Watson, Christoph Waltz, WME’s Ari Emanuel and wife Sarah Staudinger (of L.A. fashion brand Staud), Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis, Fiona Shaw and Lisa Edelstein, plus artists Doug Aitken, Adam Alessi and Andrea. But the real stars of Frieze aren’t always the bold-faced names — they’re the boldly dressed ones. Among the thousands who turned out for day one, a remarkable number seemed to have treated their outfits as entries in the show itself: an edgy parade of avant-garde eyewear, sculptural footwear and statement headwear competing gamely with the art on the walls. As one attendee put it: “You can see art — or you can be it. I choose to be it.” Steve Wilson Image Credit: Photo Credit: Thomas Drotar The Midwest hotelier and gallerist wore a canary-yellow suit designed by Kentucky artist Bri Bowers. “It’s wearable art,” he says. “Why shouldn’t an art collector like me be a walking world of art.” The red sunglasses, he notes “are my signature.” Lindsay Hawkins Image Credit: Photo Credit: Thomas Drotar The artist-slash-filmmaker donned an avant-garde skirt by London based folklore label Chopova Lowena. “I’m drawn to things that stick out, but are still comfortable,” she says. Aliona Kononova Image Credit: Photo Credit: Thomas Drotar The L.A. designer wore her own work: red bubble dress, separate white silk cape, white round cuffs and a black wood handbag. “These ivory glasses,” she says, “are by London’s Adele Mildred, inspired by Peggy Guggenheim.” Brenna Pierose and Jessica Trent Image Credit: Photo Credit: Thomas Drotar Pierose, a marketing exec, matched her two-piece Alexis dress with vintage Prada loafers. Trent, an art consultant, went with a vintage mismatched look. “I threw it all together based on a picture I recently saw by the late artist Steven Arnold.” RF Jefferies Image Credit: Photo Credit: Thomas Drotar The San Diego based art collector wears only black and only from Demma’s Balenciaga, saying, “I believe greatly in the power of clothes and the ritual of dressing.

Kennedy Jr. in 'Love Story' episode five. FX Logo text Lisa DePaulo was a feature writer for John F. Kennedy Jr.’s magazine George and has shared her opinion of the FX series Love Story for THR . She will be recapping episodes through the end of the season, beginning with episode five, titled “Battery Park,” below. *** So this one’s called “Battery Park,” due to the alleged site of the infamous knock-down ring-pulling fight between John and Carolyn that in real life was most unfortunately captured by a paparazzo in the bushes. So now there is much online consternation over whether it actually did happen in Battery Park or Washington Square Park. Oh, who bloody cares? It happened. (And I can see why Battery Park sounded better to Ryan Murphy . Battery , get it? You’re so subtle, Ryan.) Related Stories TV 'Love Story' Star Sarah Pidgeon on Recreating JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette's Infamous Battery Park Fight Guest Column I Knew JFK Jr. I Thought I Would Sob Through 'Love Story.' Instead, I Laughed Out Loud. And did he really pull her ring off? (Yes.) And — this one’s nuts — did the ring really break in half? Break in half? It was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s diamond and sapphire ring (that in a previous episode, John sneakily steals from the stash that his sister is selling at Sotheby’s). It most assuredly did not break in half. And none of this is true anyway. John did not propose to Carolyn with Jackie’s ring. And does anyone really think John Kennedy stole one of his mother’s rings? Are you kidding me? He proposed with a gorgeous and simple band of diamonds and sapphires that he designed himself and was influenced by one of Jackie’s rings, her “swimming ring.” Wait, you don’t have a swimming ring? And now do you see the kind of bullshit John and Carolyn dealt with on a daily basis? The constant dissection of their every move, every detail? I often thank the lord or the lucky stars or whoever it is you thank that John and Carolyn missed (by about a year) social media. Can you imagine ? It was already bad enough. The first day I met John, he had a stack of tabloids on his desk. The National Enquirer was on top. Yes, he read them. And at one point he said, “You know, I’m not really here,” picking up the Enquirer and laughing. “I’m on an island with Daryl Hannah .” That was John. Mercifully, John never brought the real drama into the office. And “Battery Park,” particularly the Battery Park part, made me extremely grateful for that. I know some of my colleagues saw mood changes — and I suppose you could track those to what was on the front page of the New York Post that day — but even that’s a stretch. He was always the consummate professional in the office, while still being John — funny, witty, laidback John. And speaking of the front page of the New York Post, why on earth didn’t they use the real headlines? They were so much better than the dreck they’re coming up with. Most ridiculously, episode four’s “Bum-shell!” With a photo of Carolyn’s ass on a boat. But my biggest beef with this episode, besides the abysmal dialogue (“I want this weekend to be perfect”… what happened to the witty repartee that made the previous episodes tolerable?) is the whimpering, almost-effeminate mess they’ve turned John into. The episode really should have been called “Pussy.” Which, actually, Sarah Pigeon’s Carolyn calls him at one point. Only it’s “fucking pussy.” And that is how John is portrayed throughout. That pisses me off. I can assure you, John was not a pussy. But here they have him, like a big baby, unable to commit to the long grueling hours it takes to put a magazine out (pure fiction). There he is, lip quivering, whining to his sister that he proposed to Carolyn and “she says she has to think about it.” To which Grace Gummer’s Caroline Kennedy says, “I think I might be starting to like her.” OK, that was a good line. Because for the most part, Caroline comes off as a rigid uptight shrew. (She most certainly is not.) And there he is, like a priss, instructing his beloved, “Don’t call her Ethel. Call her Mrs. Kennedy.” And then, like a smacked-ass, obeying Ethel’s orders to say Grace, with the obedience of an altar boy if an altar boy was a puppy. And oh, Ethel!!! It’s probably good that she didn’t live to see this. I prefer the other Ethel, the hot mess who raised a bunch of hoodlums at Hickory Hill, with a zoo of animals in the yard, not to mention the pets. This version sucks. From the moment she enters the dining room for dinner (what’s with Kennedy women doing weird things in dining rooms, Ryan?) and all the guests, which is to say her own kids and nieces and nephews, stand at attention. Apologizing in advance for “the bourbon brioche bread pudding dessert” that the chef “butchered spectacularly.” Then, making everyone at the table express their opinions about Cuba and Vietnam. (OK, I read that that used to happen.) And poor Carolyn — having her pashmina ridiculed at the dinner table (with her pussy boyfriend motioning for her to take it off), being forced to sleep in a separate bed from John (which PB explains away), and in the morning, being declined a cup of coffee, a cup of coffee , because she failed to “sign up” for breakfast. Because…yes, Pussy Boyfriend forgot to tell her. And by the way, what’s with casting Bobby, Jr. as normal ? Has Ryan Murphy become a secret Trumper or something? Once again, Paul Anthony Kelly plays John with a lisp. And once again, John Kennedy did not have a lisp . A barely detectable sibilance maybe, but not a lisp. Though in this episode, it fits. Fortunately, and to Murphy’s credit, there are enough moments when Pussy evolves into Pussy-whipped, which is infinitely more tolerable. And possibly even accurate. Until he assures Pigeon’s Carolyn that, don’t worry, honey, he won’t want to run for president someday. Ha! As if. THR"

Phillippe Antonello/FX (3) Logo text [This story contains major spoilers from The Beauty .] “One shot makes you hot,” reads the tagline of The Beauty , FX’s new dark comedy series laced in body horror. In what The Hollywood Reporter ’s chief TV critic Daniel Feinberg calls an “occasionally provocative blend of Nip/Tuck and various American Horror Story iterations,” Ryan Murphy’s The Beauty — written and co-created by Matt Hodgson — centers on a mysterious drug that promises unimaginable physical attractiveness. Also sexually transmissible, “The Beauty” can transform its users into what society deems perfection, though not without the risk of devastating side effects. The show asks: How much are you willing to sacrifice for eternal youth? A star-studded cast joins the ride, including Murphy regulars Evan Peters and Jeremy Pope, alongside first-time Murphy-verse additions like Ashton Kutcher, plus a slate of notable guest stars. First premiering with a three episode launch on Wednesday, Jan. 21 (at 9 p.m. ET on FX), the remaining episodes roll out weekly across the 11-episode season, with two episodes released in each of the final two weeks. Since each episode brings more familiar faces into the show, The Hollywood Reporter is keeping track of all of the stars appearing in The Beauty with explainers on the characters they play. This list originally posted Jan. 21 and will be updated weekly as new characters are revealed. Check back for spoilers!

      "full_text": "× Skip to main content Erin LeCount Photograph by Furmaan Ahmed Rising pop singer Erin LeCount says she’s always expressed herself best through music . The British performer — who released her latest EP Pareidolia Feb. 27 — says she fell in love with music at a young age thanks to a teacher who sparked her interest. She was eventually scouted for The Voice Kids in the U.K., finishing as a runner-up in season 1 after making it to the finale. “I had no idea what I was doing,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom, recalling the imposter syndrome she felt going into the program with no formal training. By 17, she found musical production and “totally fell in love.” Related Stories Movies How Anderson .Paak Turned His Son's K-Pop Obsession Into a Movie -- and a Crash Course in Filmmaking Movies Director Alexandre Trudeau Wades Into Berlin Fest's Artistic Freedom Debate: \"There's Politics Everywhere\" Now, at 23, LeCount is finding her stride, having just wrapped her first U.S. tour. She showed off a commanding stage presence during a pair of Valentine’s Day weekend shows at the Roxy in West Hollywood. Dressed in etherial white to match her long white blond hair, she directs the audience to belt out a note so she can record it. LeCount — who produces all of her music onstage — makes that note the beat for her next song. Pareidolia , her latest release, is the singer’s exploration of a downward spiral. The word itself, she points out, means finding patterns in places there aren’t — it’s a theme that runs throughout the album. Below, LeCount breaks down Pareidolia , shares on the “beautiful” connection between her song “Silver Spoon” and Heated Rivalry , and her passion for giving young women a space to hysterical. The production element seems important to you. Why has it been so important to you that you produce your own music? There’s so much misogyny that exists around female artists, and then a whole added layer of that when it comes to female artists who want ownership over their work or production. For me, it came because when I was working with other people, I was just so incredibly insecure and had so much imposter syndrome. I didn’t know how to not freeze up in a room with other people. I started doing sessions when I was about 17. You’re in rooms with people, all male, a lot older than you, and that… Everyone was lovely and everyone was kind, and I didn’t have any bad experiences, but it wasn’t something I felt able to open up in. I really felt this need to understand what was happening, and the idea of someone else being at the driving seat of my music and not understanding what was happening, I couldn’t get my head around that. I just tried to learn the language of production and the basics to communicate what I wanted. It ended up being that once I was in that rabbit hole, I fell in love with it. My brain latches onto the process of production so well. I lose hours to it, and it’s just something inherent to the music now. I’m so open to collaboration, and I’ve become more comfortable with that, but I get to what I want to say better and more truthfully when it’s just me in the beginning. There’s no room to be swayed by any external influences or impressions. Erin LeCount performs onstage during a concert on Dec. 5, 2025 in London, England. Lorne Thomson/Redferns Have you always been someone who feels they’re more able to express themselves better through music? Writing is where I figure out everything about myself that I need to be self-aware of. It’s so telling and a lot of the time making music is… When you’re in this flow state, especially being at computer and production, that’s where I hit into it. When my brain is switching between this flow between writing the song and being at the computer and your hands moving. You often reveal things to yourself that you were not aware of before that moment, and that is how I work through everything in my life. For better or worse, that comes out really honestly in the music, and I do struggle to filter that. It’s just coming from this subconscious place, and then all of a sudden it’s on paper or it’s recorded on a screen. When I play it back, it’s almost like having, I don’t know, your therapy notes read to you or something. It’s like an untangling of thoughts. It’s all incredibly personal, but I don’t really know how else to write. It’s been a communication to other people, but it’s also been a method of understanding myself and how my mind works. I’m pretty on the go all the time. I don’t stop to think about things until I sit down, and I’m at the computer and that’s the only quiet reflection time I have. As a writer in a different way, I can understand that. It’s all the same. It really is all the same. I [had always] wanted to be a writer, whether that was novels or journalism. That’s where the biggest revelations come about. Can you tell me more about some of your recent songs? Let’s start with “I Believe.” “I Believe” is the first track on this EP. It was a song when I felt really existential about what purpose is and the meaning that I apply to things. I write a lot about God for someone who’s not sure what they believe in, it’s a really ongoing theme. I have noticed that. I just keep writing as a method of untangling and that’s just a very long string to pull. It never ends. “I Believe” was questioning my identity and who I am, and how I compartmentalize all these pieces of myself and really wanting to believe in something bigger. A plan to feel that comfort. This cynicism about the whole thing. It was just a big question mark really. I think that was the perfect opening because it just opens up this entire conversation of what is my purpose? I’m going to go out and look for it. Erin LeCount attends world premiere Of ‘Wuthering Heights.’ Unique Nicole/FilmMagic What about “Don’t You See Me Trying?” [It’s the] second song of the EP; they flow directly into each other because “Don’t You See Me Trying” is about feeling out of control in your life and reverting back to old habits and self-destructive patterns because it’s the only thing you do feel you have control over. I think there’s a real theme of questioning yourself and feeling small in the grand scheme of things. Just clutching at straws to try and control what you can. The movement from “I Believe” — and [questioning] what my purpose is — and “Don’t You See Me Trying” being [about], “I don’t have one and I’m losing my mind about it, and I’m going to find a drive even if that’s a really poisonous, scary, self-destructive thing.” What does this album mean to you? It sounds like you’re working through a lot of existential things, which is quite relatable to anyone who’s been 23. I knew that I wanted to make an EP about all these different stages of a downward spiral, sort of a relapse or regression of some sort. There’s slow progression of losing your perspective and beginning to see lies in yourself through a really distorted lens. [The] pushing and pulling with that. It’s something I’ve lived really vicariously through. Making this EP was like acting out all those self-destructive tendencies through the music rather than engaging with them personally. I’ve been down and lived the sequence of events in the EP so many times, and I think I just wanted to make something productive from it. Something that felt cathartic and something that had all that impulse and that, sort of, recklessness. Pareidolia, the word, is about a tendency to perceive meaningful patterns between things that aren’t related, like shapes and clouds or a face in the moon. It was just the perfect word to sum up what our brains do when we don’t understand something or feel out of control of something or can’t perceive things correctly. We just go back to the patterns that we know and we try and make them fit and try; associate them with something new. One track that really stuck out to me was “Alice.” I thought that was a really interesting take. In a not crass way, no matter what your vice of choice is, someone who enables that behavior, even just by being there, is a really relatable idea. “Alice” is the last track on the EP because it is a bit of a gut punch, even for me to sing live. I didn’t realize how much it was until it came to touring. It’s about a person; it’s also about yourself, it’s about myself. Sometimes there’s a relationship that brings up all the things about yourself that you don’t like, and you see them reflected in another person right back at you. When you struggle with the same thing, there’s this intense bond that happens that feels like nobody else in the world could possibly understand. Sometimes that is the worst person for you to be around. That’s incredibly difficult. When I wrote that song, that feeling — of you two being the only people in the world who deal with it — sticks with you for a very long time. Furmaan Ahmed How did the song help you work through things? Writing that song took a really long time because it was hard to get an accurate and fair portrayal of both the people in that scenario. You’re navigating your relationship to each other, but you’re also navigating the relationship you have to your vices and yourself. For that all to be reflected in one person, for one person to bring that all out in you, is an incredibly scary and confronting experience. For a long time, it was a version of the song that blamed her entirely, and then it was a version that blamed me entirely. Then it was all about me and nothing about her. Other times it was too focused on the love between us and not enough on the vices that we both had that got in the way. It was a really complex song to navigate, but it’s a complex scenario to navigate. It’s far more universal than people think it is. Social media has obviously played a large part in helping you find a community. Your song “Silver Spoon” had this second wind because Heated Rivalry fans were making edits to it. It came so out of the blue. You make a song, and you selfishly think “this is so specific to me and only applicable to me.” It was the first time that instantly that was revealed to me as not true, and that it was universal in people’s lives and shows and films that people really resonated with and saw themselves in. It was really beautiful for me because I found so much of the music that I loved in the age of Tumblr to fandom edits of different shows and movies that I loved. Those edits, they take time, and they’re incredibly valuable. There are fandoms that are the reason that people found my song and found communities around it. It then led people to retrospectively go back on my work and other things I’d shared, and come forward with me and listen to the music that was coming after that. To see yourself reflected in music, to see your situation represented in shows is so important and incredibly comforting. @erinlecount i’d like to know i’m very fascinated and curious. i like ur edits very much ! very lovely. saw that nice girl crying about it. thanks 4 the kindness on silver spoon a whole year later, it’s a christmas song at heart #newmusic #femaleproducer #heatedrivalry #singersongwriter ♬ Silver Spoon – Erin LeCount When I was at your show, I was behind a group of passionate teen fans. It reminded me why I love music. What’s it like to see that for you? It’s so incredibly rewarding. Nobody rides harder or feels more intensely about things than teens or people in their mid-20s. That’s really the demographic that have been showing up for me at shows and across the board. I’ve met some of the most passionate, creative people who just make worlds of their own with the songs and what I give them. They just expand on it, creatively and within their own communities and building friendships around it. I just think there’s not enough spaces where young women and teens are encouraged to be that hysterical in the best way. When you have all that built up emotion and all these shared experiences, to be at a show and to be facilitating a space where people are able to feel that amongst each other and with their friends and release that is so important because I think “where else does it go if it doesn’t go here?” I was always incredibly cynical about showing love or passion or the hysteria that fan girls get mocked for sometimes. I wish I’d had a space like that, and I wish I’d opened myself up to that community of people who feel similarly to me. I see myself in when I was younger. It would’ve probably saved me a lot of feelings of loneliness, which is a lot of what I sing about. I could talk your ear off about teen girls making people’s careers and getting no respect for being tastemakers in music. They are the tastemakers, the dictators. They are pop culture, and they are what all these labels and businesses thrive off. What a lot of people profit off. They should be rewarded and respected and shown love and appreciation in return for that. THR"

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Mary Walsh, a veteran CBS News producer of over four decades, is exiting the company, claiming in an exit memo to staffers that instructions to “aim our reporting at a particular part of the political spectrum” are partly why she’s departing. “We’ve been reading a lot of goodbyes lately and here I am headed out the door. It’s too soon, even after 46 years,” Mary Walsh wrote in a memo sent Friday, per The Guardian . “But maybe it’s for the best. We’ve been told to aim our reporting at a particular part of the political spectrum. Honestly, I don’t know how to do that.” Related Stories Business What Sparked Paramount's Investigation of Jeff Shell Business It's a Deal: Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery Unveil $111 Billion Megamerger The Guardian further reported that CBS Evening News executive editor Kim Harvey sent a separate message to staff in response to Walsh’s memo. “We wish Mary Walsh well and thank her for many years of service,” Harvey wrote, according to the outlet. “Mary wrote in her farewell note, ‘We’ve been told to aim our reporting at a particular part of the political spectrum.’ That is simply not true. Here at the Evening News , we value our editorial independence, and CBS News leadership has never asked us to aim our reporting in any political direction.” Walsh joined CBS News in September 1982, per her LinkedIn . Her departure arrives one day after Netflix backed out of the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery, that was ultimately won by Paramount . The latter company is led by David Ellison, and has been going through changes with Bari Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief. Several CBS Evening News production staffers have taken buyouts , as the program shifts with Tony Dokoupil at the forefront. As The Hollywood Reporter previously reported on Feb. 12, 11 staffers took the buyout offer, including producer Alicia Hastey , who wrote in a departing note that she was “proud of the work that’s been done in my time here.” However, she added that “there has been a sweeping new vision prioritizing a break from traditional broadcast norms to embrace what has been described as ‘heterodox’ journalism.” “The truth is that commitment to those people [in the stories Hastey cited] and the stories they have to tell is increasingly becoming impossible,” Hastey continued. “Stories may instead be evaluated not just on their journalistic merit but on whether they conform to a shifting set of ideological expectations — a dynamic that pressures producers and reporters to self-censor or avoid challenging narratives that might trigger backlash or unfavorable headlines.” THR"

The Studio stayed strong in comedy, with Eric Kissack winning the ACE Eddie for the series premiere “The Promotion,” just as he did at the Emmys. The limited series race was of particular interest, since the single-take-driven Adolescence wasn’t nominated here (just as it wasn’t in the Emmys’ editing race). While The Penguin had three of the five Emmy-nominated episodes, it lost with the Television Academy to Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story , likely a result of vote-splitting. Here, ACE nominated only Henk van Eeghen for the series finale, and he has managed to win. It’s oddly late recognition of the drama, which aired way back in 2024 — in fact, despite its single season, this is the second straight year of ACE Eddie noms for the show because the finale fit within an extended eligibility period.

      "full_text": "Brian Stuaffer Ted Sarandos had just wrapped up a White House meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday when Warner Bros. Discovery released a statement announcing that Paramount’s latest bid for the media company was a “superior proposal” to the one that Netflix had offered. With his deal to buy the 100-year-old film and television giant hanging in the balance, Sarandos quickly consulted with a key team of executives, which included CFO Spencer Neumann and his co-CEO Greg Peters, who had been overseeing Netflix’s bid for Warners, sources say. Related Stories 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast Teams Up for INAD PSA Ahead of Rare Disease Day Under the terms of its agreement to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix had four business days to equal or surpass a better offer. But the numbers didn’t lie. Paramount was now willing to pay $31 per share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its struggling cable business. Netflix, which only wanted Warners’ studio and streaming business, did not want to dramatically enhance its bid of $27.75 per share. Sarandos didn’t see the point of dragging things out. Popular on Variety “If you know you’re not going to match an offer on day one, why wait until day four?” a source with knowledge of the deliberations said. Sarandos placed a call to David Zaslav , Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO, to let him know the streamer was walking away from a pact that would have given Netflix control of a library that included everything from Harry Potter to Batman and Tony Soprano. Then Sarandos and Peters released a joint statement in which they said, “We’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.” “This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price,” they added. An internal email was sent out to Netflix staffers that hit similar notes; namely that the streamer didn’t want to overextend itself and would concentrate on growing organically rather than by acquisitions, as it has done for most of its nearly 30-year history. However, the brave face put on by the co-CEOs could not shade the truth that the company had been gearing up for what was likely to be a transformational acquisition — and then suddenly, it wasn’t. “This deal could have accelerated Netflix’s growth on top of a strong existing trajectory by attracting new subscribers, reducing churn and driving more engagement,” wrote Robert Fishman, media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. In December, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav hosted Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters on the Warner Bros. Studio lot to meet with leaders across the company. Joe Pugliese and John Nowak for Warner Bros. Discovery Netflix was wholeheartedly preparing for a regulatory fight to close the deal at the moment earlier this month that it agreed to WBD’s unusual request for a waiver from the merger agreement reached on Dec. 5 in order to hold negotiations with Paramount Skydance, according to an individual with knowledge of the situation. At the same time, WBD’s board was under pressure from investors and corporate watchdogs to engage with Paramount Skydance, which went from making unsolicited offers last fall to filing a lawsuit against WBD in January in an effort to force it to disclose more details about the valuation methodology used in reaching Netflix’s $27.75 per share offer. It all added up to a lot of noise. Netflix was ready to fight fire with fire — until Sarandos and Peters decided to bow out. That decision too — described by one observer as “putting shareholder value above executive ego” — is drawing praise from the investment community. “It signals that Netflix believes in its internal growth story enough to maintain M&A discipline. We also believe the future Paramount Skydance Warner Bros. Discovery — they’ll need a better name — could finally transform two subscale media companies into a more serious industry player, provided management has the financial flexibility to execute on its vision,” Fishman wrote. Paramount’s new owner, David Ellison , has been relentless in his pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, working his connections on Capitol Hill, while making a spirited case that his company was offering a better deal for shareholders. This month, he and his team pulled off what many analysts and industry figures thought was impossible, forcing Warner Bros. Discovery to come back to the negotiating table. And Ellison was determined to make the most of the opportunity. While fine-tuning his pitch, he relied on a core team of trusted advisors and board members such as Safra Katz, Justin Hamill and Gerry Cardinale. Paramount’s Chief Operating Officer Andy Gordon worked closely with his investor relations group and advisor Faiza Saeed of the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Melissa Zukerman, Paramount’s chief communications officer, also was involved in the strategy sessions. Conspicuously absent from all WBD-related proceedings was Paramount president Jeff Shell, who is currently embroiled in controversy over allegations he leaked sensitive financials in CBS’ $7 billion UFC deal. During the seven-day negotiating period that ran Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, WBD and Paramount Skydance leaders never once met as a group in person. All the discussions were held via video conference calls, emails and by phone. There was an evident chill — or at least lack of chumminess — between the sides. Some of that has to do with the tangled history between the players. Paramount’s unsolicited offer to buy WBD last September set off a domino effect that forced Zaslav and his team to hold an auction for the company much sooner than they had planned. And Paramount’s desire to buy WBD’s linear cable channels derailed the plan that was in the works to spin them off into a standalone company dubbed Discovery Global. Despite the bad blood, a weekend of virtual talks between Paramount and WBD saw Ellison’s ninth offer sweetened from $30 per share to $31. Paramount also offered shareholders a “ticking fee” for each quarter the acquisition might be stuck in the regulatory process. It was an offer David Zaslav couldn’t refuse. Ellison was taking meetings at Skydance’s sleek Santa Monica headquarters on Friday when word came down that the path had been cleared for Paramount to take WBD. Shortly before Netflix publicly bowed out, champagne was rolled into the executive suite at Paramount’s Melrose lot. The mood was ebullient, partly because while Netflix deemed Warner Bros. “nice to have,” Ellison always saw the studio as “must have” if he was going to realize his ambitions to create a new media leviathan. But now comes the even harder part. If Paramount is able to secure regulatory approval, a process that insiders predict will take at least a year, it will have to find a way to grow the company’s streaming business while overseeing the decline of cable. And it will have to pull off that transition while servicing more than $78 billion in debt. That’s left some industry executives skeptical that Paramount will make good on its promise to increase its output of streaming programming, while making 30 theatrical film releases a year, the most of any studio by a wide margin. Indeed, if the WBD transaction is completed, Team Ellison will have an even steeper climb to bring the enlarged Paramount back to the summit of Hollywood. The vertical merger of Paramount and Warner Bros.’ film and TV studio operations is guaranteed to be a bloodbath of layoffs and a senior management “Game of Thrones” environment as the new regime decides who stays and who goes between Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures as well as Warner Bros. Television, CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios, among many other imprints. The same questions loom over HBO Max and Paramount+ and the management of WBD’s large portfolio of linear cable channels that include CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Food Network and HGTV. Given the behind the scenes drama that has enveloped CBS News since Ellison took over Paramount Skydance, the mood was grim at CNN after the news broke in real time Thursday. One persistent sentiment shared by staffers from various divisions of WBD was what one studio insider described as “complete and total fucking merger fatigue.” If completed, the Paramount transaction will mark the third time that Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, TNT and other channels have been sold to new owners just since 2018, when AT&T sealed its purchase of Time Warner, after winning an antitrust trial in the first Trump administration. That was followed in 2022 by the WarnerMedia merger with Zaslav’s Discovery Inc. In both cases, WB and HBO endured a long period of limbo while legal and regulatory processes ensued. And all of that has unfolded under the backdrop of massive disruption across the entertainment business. WBD troops were bracing for another long merger slog regardless. But as the tables turned quickly on Thursday afternoon, many rank and file staffers expressed regret that the studio would not be hitched to the industry’s dominant subscription streaming platform but rather to a smaller, struggling rival legacy media conglomerate. There is great skepticism about Ellison’s ability to make the high-wire act work while Paramount Skydance shoulders a mountain of debt supplied by a consortium that includes Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. “Debt is debt,” says Rick Morris, a professor at Northwestern University’s School of Communication. “Debt will stop them from taking new initiatives, from investing in content, and it’ll take a period of time to work off. And many companies fail at working off the debt, and that is part of the reason that Warner Bros. is for sale.” There is little doubt that Paramount Skydance will make massive cuts to WBD operations for the sake of de-leveraging the balance sheet. If all goes as planned, the company will carry a debt ratio of nearly 7 times its annual earnings — a huge red flag for credit agencies and many investors. Paramount has pledged to swiftly cut its debt-to-earnings ratio down to 4.4 times earnings, which means finding billions of dollars in cost savings from the jump. The WBD transaction is backed up to an unprecedented degree by a guarantee made by Larry Ellison against his personal fortune, buoyed by shares in Oracle, the software giant that he co-founded in 1977 when computing was in its infancy. Larry Ellison is also on the hook to invest many more billions should the enlarged Paramount Skydance struggle to maintain enough cash flow to support operations. Laurent Yoon, media analyst with Bernstein, sees WBD as a necessity for Paramount but one that will not be easy on the rank and file tasked with running the businesses. “Overpaying for WBD to accelerate growth is perhaps better than facing a mediocre standalone trajectory — at least this gives [Paramount] a shot at greatness, in our view.. But we do not expect them to come out swinging too hard,” Yoon wrote in a Feb. 26 research note. “Before they can invest in growth, they’ll need to cut deep and fast, and allocate most of their free cash flow to interest expense and de-levering. This is effectively the same position WBD was in from ‘22 (post-merger) through ‘25, a period that constrained growth despite having quality studios and IPs.” In the Netflix-WBD merger scenario, filmmakers were concerned about Netflix’s commitment to the theatrical business , noting that Sarandos had earlier dismissed cinemas as “outdated.” That left them skeptical of the company’s promises that it would continue to release Warners films on the big screen and honor traditional home entertainment windows. Paramount, in contrast, has loudly argued that it is the true defender of the cinematic experience and has promised to increase the number of films that the combined studios will release in theaters. Yet having Paramount own Warners Bros. Discovery has raised other concerns for artists, some of whom worry that Ellison’s coziness with the Trump administration will stifle free expression. They’ve been alarmed by his moves at CBS News, where he has installed Bari Weiss, a conservative columnist best known for her anti-woke jeremiads, as editor-in-chief. It’s expected that Weiss will have a big role in steering CNN down the road. “Ellison scares the shit out of me,” says one A-list director. “Are the movies they put out going to be catered to Trump’s taste? Are they going to start cracking down on content that they don’t find to be ideologically aligned with the right?” Ellison has earned that skepticism. In his aggressive pursuit of WBD, he has not been shy about flexing his family’s wealth (his father Larry Ellison is one of the world’s richest men) and connections to President Donald Trump. In lobbying publicly and privately for Paramount’s unsolicited WBD bids, Team Ellison sought to amp up concerns about Netflix exerting monopoly power over the streaming pay TV marketplace and having the ability to dictate pricing and deal terms for Hollywood’s creative community. The Ellisons also made their case to regulators in the U.K. and European Union, which have a track record of tougher enforcement of antitrust and concentration issues. David Ellison went so far as to attend Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham , a key confidant of the president. One observer compared Ellison’s trek to the Capitol earlier this week to the row of tech leaders who attended Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 — an image that has become symbolic of the fact that big business and moguls — the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook — are kowtowing to Trump’s authoritarian style of leadership. “This process speaks volumes,” says J. Christopher Hamilton, a professor of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications and an attorney. “Companies don’t have to go behind the scenes any longer to court lawmakers and this administration doesn’t feel like it has to be subtle about who it wants to reward and who it prefers to own businesses.” Netflix’s Sarandos also invested in personally lobbying political leaders on the merits of the deal. He endured a two-hour grilling in the Senate at a hearing on Feb. 4 that demonstrated the depth of the fight that Netflix would face. In addition to federal pressure, state attorneys general are lining up to launch their own local probes into the transaction. Now they will focus more on vertical-merger issues for two companies with mostly overlapping operations versus the specter of monopoly power — a loaded term that raised the stakes for Netflix no matter how many times Sarandos pointed to independent Nielsen audience data showing that even combining the streaming service with HBO did not rise to the level of what is traditionally considered to be a monopoly-level of market share. On Friday, as Netflix staffers digested all the news, more than a few executives expressed the feeling that the streamer may have dodged a bullet. And for their troubles, Paramount Skydance will pay them the $2.8 billion breakup fee that Netflix negotiated in the agreement it inked with WBD’s board on Dec. 5. “I think there’s a sense of relief on the Netflix side that we came close to getting it, and now we have an out and we got paid for the time we spent doing it. There’s some disappointment in not getting what you want and a relief that you didn’t get it,” said a senior entertainment lawyer with knowledge of the situation. Now, as the town’s attention shifts from the bidding war to what is likely to be a war of attrition, there are fears that the union of Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures will result in one fewer buyer of films — and that WB will be hamstrung on dealmaking and big long-term swings while it waits for the sale to close. Already, filmmakers say that it’s taking longer for them to get an answer from the studio on the status of their projects, noting that the company is wary of committing too much money to new films when a different ownership team is waiting in the wings. Ellison’s politics have alarmed many in left-leaning Hollywood, but some people are impressed with the executive team he has installed at Paramount. Josh Greenstein, who was brought over from Sony Pictures to help oversee the film studio with Dana Goldberg, has earned high marks for making tough calls on film projects, while urging the studio to land splashy projects from the likes of James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet. “Josh is the real deal,” says one media executive who has worked with him. “He is a straight shooter. And in a matter of months he’s stocked a cupboard that was bare.” At the same time, Warner Bros. Pictures has been on an unprecedented roll at the box office since the second half of 2025, after enduring some painful flops in 2024 and early in 2025. To many, it feels as though just as WB Pictures chiefs Pam Abdy and Michael De Luca were hitting their stride with commercial and critical successes — the studio’s “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” are this year’s top film award season contenders — the executive turnstiles are about to swing once again. “If they’re smart, they’ll keep Mike and Pam,” says the media executive. “But there’s only so much executive power to go around. Decisions will need to be made.” For Paramount, the road ahead will be paved with key management and strategic decisions, as well as a herculean effort to revitalize two media giants that have often struggled to navigate the streaming era. Up the road from Paramount’s Melrose lot in Hollywood, Netflix brass also face momentous decisions about their future. But first they’ll need to figure out what to do with the $2.8 billion check that Paramount wrote them on Friday. Think of it as a dowry that a jilted suitor gets to keep.

The tentpole was Snyder’s sequel to the already-polarizing “Man of Steel,” which sent comic book fans into a tizzy for depicting Superman killing Zod, and “BvS” only divided fans further with Batman killing criminals, the two heroes bonding over their moms both being named Martha and more. Related Stories 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast Teams Up for INAD PSA Ahead of Rare Disease Day “My 100% honest reaction to ‘BvS’ and how it’s received in the world is… Do you really want a movie that’s had all the edges shaved off it by the focus groups?” Snyder said in defense of the movie 10 years later. “Do you really want a movie where the decisions have been made in a boardroom, or tested ideas have been rendered for your enjoyment? Do you really want the Kmart version of your story? Is that what you really want?” Popular on Variety “Batman v Superman” was the second movie in Snyder’s DC Universe, dubbed the ‘SnyderVerse’ online by his legion of fans. “Justice League” came next with its own polarizations after Snyder left the production due to a family tragedy and the studio brought in Joss Whedon to rewrite scenes and conduct reshoots. This led to a social media movement of Snyder fans calling Warner Bros to release the “Snyder Cut” of “Justice League,” which the studio permitted. “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” debuted on HBO Max in 2021. “I love the mythological journey we went on in these three movies,” Snyder said. “The intensity of where we ended up with ‘Justice League’ and how it evovled and where it came from. That whole insanity. When we were trying for the PG-13 rating on ‘BvS,’ the MPAA kept kicking the movie back to us saying, ‘It’s still an R.’ I remember someone saying we got a report from the MPA saying, ‘We just don’t like the idea of Batman fighting Superman. That kind of makes it an R. He really hits him hard with that sink. That’s rude. That feels like an R.’ I’m just like, ‘Okay… let’s just pretend it’s not Batman vs. Superman for one second.'” “You realize then that we were kicking the zeitgeist in the nuts and that we were going to anger people,” Snyder continued. “Not only do they not want their heroes deconstructed, they don’t want their heroes battling each other on a road to deconstructing the why of their existence. That’s another sacrilege.” The Snyder Verse ended before Snyder got to make two more “Justice League” movies, although he admitted on the podcast that he’s “absolutely talked about” bringing those two movies to life somehow in other mediums like a comic book or animation. Snyder added: “We live in a world where all that is possible.” “I would never say there is no way,” Snyder said when asked about his fans’ continued pleas for the SnyderVerse to continue. “I was on the ride that created ‘Justice League,’ and if you were in my shoes there were numerous times, dark times, when there was no chance that there will ever be my version of it. It will never exist. It can’t… cost, politics, everything stood against. And yet it exists. The fans should never forget they did that. They also raised a ton of money for suicide prevention. They did a lot of good. They catch a lot of flak for being toxic or whatever, but they literally saved human lives. You can go fuck yourselves if that’s what you think.” The DC Universe has since been revived at Warner Bros. under the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Gunn directed a new “Superman” movie that was greeted with a mostly positive critical and fan reception upon release last year. “James is cool. I wish them all the best. It is what it is,” Snyder said. “That three movie trilogy is a weed that just won’t die. It grows on its own. It has its own life. It’s not concerned with James’ Superman, which is amazing and all the best to them. I can’t wait to see the next movie. It’s awesome. To me, it’s not the same thing. It’s a different thing.” Watch Snyder’s full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below. ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘Squid Game’ Top Nielsen’s Most-Streamed Original Series of 2025 List ‘Stranger Things’ Creators Defend Will’s Coming Out Scene and Confront Toxic Fan Review Bombing: ‘The Ultimate F— You to Vecna’ ‘Stranger Things’ Doc Director on Filming the Discussion About Demogorgons in the Final Battle and That Ambiguous Ending: ‘That’s the Reaction the Duffer Brothers Wanted’ (EXCLUSIVE) David Harbour Exits Tony Gilroy’s Searchlight Drama ‘Behemoth!’ Variety Scores GLAAD Media Award Nominations for Outstanding Print Article and Magazine Overall Coverage ‘Stranger Things’ and Prince: The Complicated Road to Bringing ‘When Doves Cry’ and ‘Purple Rain’ to the Show’s Finale Loading comments...

I don’t know lately if it’s changed. I couldn’t do any major film or anything connected with Hollywood. I found agents ultimately in England and in Italy, and I work there. I just did a film in Italy, and I did a play at the Old Vic for a number of months. I know this Italian director that just hired me — he was told not to hire me, so that’s still recently. He didn’t listen, but they had that conversation. Right now, I kind of specialize in tiny films with directors who have never directed, in independent films.” Related Stories 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast Teams Up for INAD PSA Ahead of Rare Disease Day The “Thelma and Louise” star also said that Spain has more intellectual freedom than the United States. Popular on Variety “In a place where you feel repression and censorship, to see Spain and to see the president and what he says and the support that he’s giving about Gaza, and to have actors like Javier Bardem come forward with such a strong voice, is so important to us in the United States,” she said.

Ghostface is back in theaters, and so is Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott after sitting out “Scream 6.” In “Scream 7,” Sidney is now a mother to a teenage daughter named Tatum (Isabel May), who gets caught up in her own twisted cat-and-mouse game with the masked killer. Like past “Scream” movies, there’s buckets of blood, shocking kills and one big unmasking at the end of the movie — plus several cameos from past films. The Ghostface killers rack up quite the bodycount in “Scream 7.” Right off the bat, horror movie lovers Scott (Jimmy Tatro) and Madison (Michelle Randolph) are murdered after renting the home that belonged to Matthew Lillard’s Stu Macher in the original “Scream.” Over in Pine Grove, Sidney receives an eerie message from Stu, apparently back from the grave. He claims that he survived his death in “Scream” and is back as Ghostface to get his revenge on Sidney and her family. One of the Ghostfaces then kills Tatum’s classmate Hannah (Mckenna Grace) at her high school’s play rehearsal then goes to Sidney’s house. After a fight with Sidney, her husband Mark (Joel McHale) and Tatum, that Ghostface is run over by reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who’s joined by her new camera crew Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason Gooding) from the past two “Scream” movies. Ghostface is revealed to be an unknown murderer who escaped from an insane asylum and had been stalking Sidney. After visiting the mental institution and talking to a supervisor, Sidney finds out that Stu had apparently survived his death. The real Ghostface starts picking off his victims one by one: Tatum’s friend (Celeste O’Connor), Sidney’s neighbor’s son Lucas (Asa Germann) and Tatum’s boyfriend Ben (Sam Rechner) all die. Mark is wounded, but later survives. It’s also revealed that “Stu” is an AI deepfake created by Marco (Ethan Embry), the supervisor at the mental institute. He makes the AI video transform into late sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Nancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), who was the Ghostface from “Scream 2,” and Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the killer from “Scream 3.” However, the real brains behind the Ghostface killing spree turns out to be Sidney’s neighbor Jessica (Anna Camp). After unmasking, she says she was inspired by Sidney’s autobiography and thought she needed to murder her own husband to reach the same levels of success. When that didn’t work, she discovered where Sidney lived, met Marco and decided to kidnap Tatum to put her through the same Ghostface killings that Sidney survived. But in the end, Sidney and Tatum are able to kill Marco and Jessica (who’s shot repeatedly in the head) and escape with their lives. With Sidney, Tatum and Mark alive, could they star in an eighth movie and face off against another Ghostface? Mindy and Chad also survive the finale, and in the mid-credits scene they shoot their own news broadcast about the killings; perhaps they could follow in Gale’s reporting footsteps. “Scream” creator Kevin Williams has ideas for an eighth movie, but so far nothing has been officially announced. See the past “Scream” cameos that appear in the seventh movie below. Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard) Stu was one of the original Ghostfaces in the original “Scream,” alongside Sidney’s boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), and fans have long theorized that he may have survived his death in the 1996 film after a TV fell on his head. Matthew Lillard returns to play the deranged horror movie fan, but it’s eventually revealed he’s an AI deepfake used to torment Sydney. Nancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf) Laurie Metcalf plays local reporter Debbie Salt, who’s later revealed to be original Ghostface Billy Loomis’ vengeful mother Nancy in “Scream 2.” She has it out for Sidney after the heroine killed Billy in the original “Scream.” Nancy later turns on her fellow Ghostface Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but is killed in her final showdown with Sidney. She appears as an AI recreation toward the end of “Scream 7.” Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) Scott Foley played Roman Bridger, director of the in-universe film “Stab 3” who’s revealed to be Sidney’s half-brother in “Scream 3.” Roman was the only solo Ghostface in the franchise, and his actions secretly dated back to the original “Scream.” He was the product of his and Sidney’s mother Maureen being sexually assaulted, but Maureen later rejected him as a son. Spurned by his mother, Roman filmed her affair with Billy Loomis’ father years ago and showed Billy the footage, causing him to go on the original murder spree in “Scream.” Sidney kills Roman in the “Scream 3” finale, and he appears as AI at the end of “Scream 7.” Dewey Riley (David Arquette) David Arquette first starred as Dewey Riley, deputy sheriff of Woodsboro, in the original “Scream” and appeared in every film until his death in “Scream 5.” He had survived stabbings by multiple Ghostfaces throughout the years, but he was finally killed for good in the 2022 reboot (or “requel”).

Everything has changed for Hannah Dodd ‘s Francesca in Season 4 of “Bridgerton.” Dodd took over the role of Francesca for the show’s third season, after the departure of Ruby Stokes. Since then, Francesca debuted in society, and then met, fell in love with and married John Stirling, Earl of Kilmartin ( Victor Alli ). Fans of Julia Quinn’s “Bridgerton” novels — the source material for Netflix’s mega-hit drama — know that the story doesn’t end there. Francesa’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is the sixth installment in the series, and focuses on her romance with Michael Stirling, her late husband John’s cousin, who has loved her from the moment they met. As Season 3 set up Francesca and John’s love for each other, John’s rakish cousin finally made an appearance in the finale — as a woman named Michaela ( Masali Baduza ), in a dramatic gender-flipped departure from the book. While “Bridgerton” has introduced same-sex relationships to the show, it is unclear how the theme will be tackled in upcoming seasons. Francesca’s brother, and Season 4 lead, Benedict, was previously introduced as bisexual and came out to his now-wife, Sophie, during a heartfelt conversation in Part 2 . Regardless, Francesca and Michaela (dubbed “Franchaela” by fans) will be Bridgerton’s first central couple to be queer, as well as the show’s first Sapphic storyline. As for when that will happen, though Shondaland and Netflix haven’t yet announced who will be the lead character for Season 5, Francesca’s arc in the fourth season make her the prime candidate. (When Variety ‘s Jenny Maas asked showrunner Jess Brownell this question about Francesa, Brownell said, “Can you just put ‘laughs’?” And then added, “Interesting theory.”) Although no overtly romantic moments have passed between the duo yet, they’ve shared several scenes as Michaela’s outgoing and impulsive nature grates against Francesca’s need for order and repressed feelings. Much to the happiness of their mutually beloved John, the two eventually clear the air between them and strike up a friendship. Everything seems to be on track for the newly formed Kilmartin family, until John, suffering from a headache, lies down for a nap in Episode 6 and never wakes back up. The next two episodes feature a devastated Francesca as she attempts to navigate her grief, her suppressed emotions hard to read, until she reveals she is trying to stay calm for the sake of her pregnancy. But when the pregnancy turns out to be a false alarm, she has a devastating meltdown in her mother’s arms. Related Stories 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast Teams Up for INAD PSA Ahead of Rare Disease Day Through it all, her one steady source of comfort remains Michaela, the only one who understands the depth of her loss. Poles apart in character, Michaela proposes a joyful celebration of life for John, where Francesca finally smiles and thanks her for her support. Seemingly a united front, Michaela agrees to stay in London upon Francesca’s request, but secretly flees in the finale. Here, Baduza and Dodd, and Alli in a separate interview, speak with Variety about the trio’s love for each other, what’s next for Francesca’s character arc — and what John’s death means for Francesca and Michaela’s romance. Popular on Variety This is the first time we’ve seen a queer relationship in the spotlight on “Bridgerton.” Is there any added pressure to depict this particular storyline? Hannah Dodd: We’re mainly really, really excited and very proud to get to tell that story, and tell it in a way that it’s the lead storyline and not just the side characters. They get a full eight-episode arc as they deserve, and hopefully there’s audiences that feel really represented and included. Do Francesca and Michaela have feelings for each other at this point? And, more importantly, are they aware of them? Masali Baduza: I think Michaela has feelings for Francesca. I think that she has pushed them down to the very bottom, but they are there, and she isn’t really acknowledging them. Obviously, Francesca is her cousin’s wife, so it’s a lot for her, but she’s definitely feeling that level of attraction for Francesca. Dodd: I think Francesca isn’t even aware of that as a possibility. As much as she’s feeling feelings , she doesn’t really know where they come from and why. For the most part, it’s a confronting energy for her. [Michaela] is somebody who lives their life in quite an opposite way. It’s a little bit like triggering for Francesca, and makes her question herself. There’s a response that comes from Francesca when she’s with Michaela, but I don’t think she has any idea what that is — yet. After helping each other navigate their grief, Michaela promises Francesca she’ll stay in London but ends up leaving without a word. Why is that? Baduza: Michaela’s feeling a lot of emotions, and she’s very overwhelmed. I think that her coping mechanism is to just run away and pretend like nothing is happening. If she’s not there to face it, then she doesn’t have to deal with it. She’s constraining herself, and in doing so, is hurting Francesca a lot. She’s just looking out for herself. It’s clear to viewers that Michaela has an overwhelming effect on Francesca, who ends up being a bit stand-offish toward her. How does Michaela read Francesca’s confusing behavior toward her? Baduza: Michaela thinks maybe that Francesca’s lived a very sheltered life. She’s not used to anything or anyone that really disrupts her state of peace. Michaela reads that as friction and tension. But again, she’s not someone who really loves to interrogate what she’s feeling in the moment. If it’s very hard for her, she’ll give it back to her, or deflect, or just not be in the space and in the environment whatsoever. John’s last scene is him completing a puzzle with Francesca and Michaela, where he does the ground, and Michaela finishes the sky. His last shot in the show is him looking at Francesca and Michaela getting along with fondness. Did you play into the symbolism of that? What was John feeling in that moment? Dodd: I think that whole scene is a metaphor, and is sort of a symbol for their relationship. I think it’s very, very clever and very well-written that they both complete Francesca’s puzzle [and the pieces they choose] really represent their characters as well. Whether or not the characters are aware of things, I do think it’s something that you can look back on, and it feels like a bit of a blessing. Victor Alli: It’s interesting because John doesn’t know what’s happening next, so I had to play every moment as is, and not think about it being my last. It is really symbolic, but I didn’t want to lean into it too much, and wanted to [keep] it sort of simple. What does John hope for Francesca and Michaela individually? Alli: That post John’s passing, Francesca is able to find her feet again. John would want her to be happy, and would be behind whatever she decides to do. She shouldn’t feel the pressure of having to stay in this wallowing rut, and he expects her to bloom. And with Michaela, he would want her to shine in every single way. She’s such a big part of his life, and he’d want her to carry on the family name and be a Stirling ambassador, whatever that may mean. How is John going to continue to influence Michaela and Francesca’s relationship as it builds? Dodd: John’s an integral character for both of us, and he’s had such an impact on both our lives. He’s what connects them, but also what separates them. He’s going to be with them, as anybody who leaves you is, forever. Baduza: Exactly, and they’ll always be family on some level, because they shared John. Alli: I think there will always be a part of John in Francesca and Michaela, because ultimately, he’s the thing that united them both. Of course, they have to find their own feet and their own journey together. But he’s the glue. So, hopefully, there might be moments where he’s spoken about and remembered, because he’s an integral part of their relationship. What’s next for Francesca and Michaela in terms of reconciliation after Michaela’s departure? Dodd: It is gonna take some work, definitely. They’re both in pain, so I do hope that there’s grace given to both of them. Everybody goes through those things very differently, and it can do things to you. You’re not always your best self in those situations. Baduza: I hope that Michaela comes back to apologize, sets the record straight with Francesca and explains why she did what she did. It would be lovely to see that. I hope so. Fingers crossed. Throughout the season, Francesca is struggling with being unable to have a baby. After John’s passing, there’s a moment where she thinks she might be pregnant but realizes she isn’t, followed by a particularly difficult conversation with her mother, when Francesca says she feels she failed John by not being able to make him a father. How much of Francesca’s grief is her not having a baby versus guilt over not being able to do something for her husband, whom she loved? Dodd: I don’t know if she knows. She’s got a tsunami of feelings. I think it’s something that connects her and her mum, and there’s this idea that this is how her mum got through [the loss of her husband]. I don’t completely know if she’s aware of what is “societal” and what are her own thoughts. I do think that she really, really wanted a baby, and I think that [having one] would have also been devastating in its own right, but also been a piece of John that she gets to keep. It could have given her a purpose, and she’s somebody who would have benefited from that. But sometimes when life goes in unexpected ways, that’s where you can grow the most. There’s so much pressure on women and expectations, and I think for her to work out what she wants and who she is, she needs to break away from all of that. One of the major plot points in Francesca’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is her struggle with infertility and wanting a child. Is that something that will be incorporated into the show for Francesca and Michaela’s storyline? Dodd: I’m sure what the writers will come up with will be beautiful and wonderful, and there’ll be elements of the book incorporated. Obviously, we have done the infertility storyline, so whether or not that continues, I don’t know, but I do think it’s a really interesting dynamic, and queer couples are included in that story as well. Just because we’re doing a queer storyline, it doesn’t mean that that won’t fit into it, and I’m excited to find out. Francesca is very overwhelmed by all of the attention from her family is giving her, but does continue to seek Michaela out. In addition to her being John’s cousin, is there a reason why Francesca finds her presence comforting? Dodd: I think it’s a combination of things. There is an instinctual thing — an unspoken and not really understood connection there. Michaela is somebody that she is drawn to, whether or not it’s because she frustrates her, whether or not it’s because she represents home and knows John. But nobody knew John like Francesca and Michaela. She’s really looking for comfort in somebody who is actually experiencing what she’s feeling. As much as everybody around the family loved John, Michaela is the only one who is grieving in the same way as she is, so she’s looking for that familiarity and that comfort from her. But there is a bit of an instinctive pull there as well. Speaking of John and Michaela’s relationship, there’s a scene at Michaela’s welcome-to-society party, where John is adamant that Francesca not attempt to set Michaela up with suitors and gets quite upset when she does. Is there a reason behind that? Baduza: It was never explicitly said. But Victor and I talked a lot about the fact that Michaela would have shared her sexuality with him, or her figuring it out, with him. John is very protective over Michaela. They have a very close sibling relationship, so he knows her very well. He knows that she’s not in the market for her husband, probably never will be. He knows what society expects of her and that she’s just not willing to do that. Alli: He knows Michaela really well and knows that Francesca means well. But John is sort of like, “It’s more than that.” Michaela is not ready for marriage and all that comes with it. She’s pretty content being single and seeing people, and she’s just waiting for the right time and the right love. Does John pick up on any of the romantic tension between the two of them? Baduza: I don’t think so. He would never expect his cousin to be into his wife. Alli: I don’t think he does. He’s so invested in his marriage that he just wants that. It wouldn’t even cross his mind that there’s something there. Throughout the season, Michaela gives Francesca a lot of difficult-to-decipher looks, especially during John’s funeral. How was she feeling overall and dealing with a confusing mix of emotions? Baduza: I think Michaela was definitely in her own world at the funeral. She couldn’t have been there for Francesca, because she was grappling with the loss of her brother. She was just overwhelmed and maybe was thinking of possible exit plans. She was just going through it and also grieving her brother with this family that she’s also getting to know. So she’s just not in the most comfortable environment. The pregnancy test Francesca undergoes is, quite frankly, very invasive. How does that add to the stress of the situation for Francesca? Dodd: It’s awful. It’s just horrible. You’ve got a grieving woman who has also been quite sheltered, so it’s so invasive, even filming it. I think [being pregnant] was something that she was hanging on to. If there was any hope in that situation, it was the baby. So to have that ripped away from her as well, it’s just like, what else can you take? She’s at absolute ground zero, especially once Michaela leaves; she doesn’t know what life looks like anymore. She’s worked so hard to create that life. It’s an opportunity for her to start again, which is horrendous for anybody to have to do, but there’s an opportunity there for her to actually get to know [herself]. There’s a really interesting dynamic of you can’t take anything else from me. I’m hoping that that will kind of contribute towards growth, because she’s been quite a little girl scared of the world, and “what else can you do to me?” is a really interesting place to take her. Just to switch gears for a second, how do you envision the Bridgertons breaking the Sophie scandal to Francesca in the middle of everything she’s dealing with? Dodd: I know! I know! Francesca is still very close to her family, so I like the idea of Eloise [telling her], just because I think they’re sort of besties. But Francesca would have been like, “OK, do you know what’s going on in my life?” Maybe she would have had something to say in support, like “love whilst you have time.” As awful as it is, maybe there was some motivation that’s given. Speaking of the Bridgertons, they’re a very close-knit family, and you really see that they want to be there for Francesca. Benedict and Hyacinth are really upset by John’s passing in particular, and it affect their actions throughout the next few episodes. How do you think his death affects the family at large? Dodd: It’s really interesting, because the death of our father has connected us as a family. It’s sort of the core of what the Bridgertons are and why we are so close as a family. To see them all kind of go through it again, it’s quite a visceral reaction. They are so close, and they do really feel for Francesca, but I do think it’s because some of them have been there before as well, that reality is probably quite difficult to replay and go through. It’s a beautiful family dynamic where they really lean on each other. There’s still a lot to explore within the siblings and their different relationships. I’m looking forward to hopefully getting to explore some other relationships out of this situation. But it definitely shakes all of them to their core.

It’s so different from virtually every other album the group ever recorded over a nearly 50-year period, there will always be some split over that — maybe even internally, because even core member Al Jardine says he wasn’t that high on the record until relatively recently. But it’s fair to say that if you are really, really, really into the recorded output of Brian Wilson , there’s an outstanding chance you have consumed whatever Kool-Aid is necessary to have joined the choir of fans who have been singing the praises of “Love You” ever since it came out and flopped. Related Stories 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast Teams Up for INAD PSA Ahead of Rare Disease Day Now, it’s getting its due and then some. Al Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band — which is essentially the group that toured with Brian Wilson as a solo artist for many years — have been doing tour dates where they’ve performed most of the “Love You” album live. On Friday night, for the very first time ever, the ensemble will play the entire record, not leaving out a single track. Anyone who has heard them perform any of this material live will know it’s well worth the pilgrimage… as is any set of theirs that’s mostly limited to the core canon, given how faithfully they have been bringing any Brian song to full-fleshed life for decades before and months since the pop genius’ death. Popular on Variety Before a different SoCal show recently, Variety caught up backstage with Jardine and one of the key architects of the Brian Wilson/Pet Sounds Band, Darian Sahanaja , who was known as a member of the L.A. group the Wondermints before he began training virtually all his passion onto the Wilson ouevre. Following is an edited version of that conversation. In the meantime, for anyone reading this before Friday night’s show, it takes place at the United Theater on Broadway in downtown L.A. at 8 p.m. Tickets can be found here . For an itinerary of other upcoming shows, in which a good chunk of “Love You” might still be played, check here . (For those who can’t make it to a show — or those who can — there is also a new boxed set out from UMe that focuses on the “Love You” album and its outtakes, along with material from right before and after that project. Read more about that collection in Variety ‘s previous coverage here .) Al Jardine: We should bring in some of the fellas in the band, because it’s fascinating from their point of view. They’re the ones that talked me into doing this “Love You” album. It’s a pretty big deal. They call Darian the librarian. He’s got all this stuff in the back of his head, and he wanted to do this in a bad way. And I thought it was a great way to put the band back together, after Brian passed. Well, even before Brian passed, we’d been trying to get the band back together. Did it help, in reforming Brian’s band, to have kind of an excuse to do something different than what you were doing when he was around? Jardine: Yeah, it gave us a focus a priority, this long-awaited completion of the idea to do the “Love You” album and bring it to the forefront of our activity, musically. The band hadn’t worked since ’22, and I just wanted to to get it back together. Thanks to Darian, we’d been sharing this idea for quite a while, but for some reason, it just never happened while Brian was with us, even though it was a very personal thing for him, especially. Who knows why. But it’s happening. [To Darian] I’m so glad you convinced me, because we kept going back and forth. He said, “If you do this, if we accomplish this, people are gonna come out of the cities, they’re gonna come out of the woods, Al…” Darian Sahanaja: Yeah, you were doubtful. I think you were kind of like, “Really? People like that album?” Jardine: Well, it was very, very understated, and my participation in it was (just) as a vocalist, coming out of the woods in Big Sur to come down to do a session. It was a major thing in itself, just physically and mentally getting into the process of recording it, and it didn’t sound like a Beach Boy album to me. It was great, but it seemed like more of a Brian project, which of course it was. It was dedicated to him by his brothers, and particularly Carl (Wilson). Carl was the de facto producer, really, and pulled us all together so that Brian would be at ease, writing these songs. Sahanaja : He was coming out of an era when he was sort of hiding out in his room and not really doing much. Well, there was that whole “Brian’s back” campaign, right? Jardine: With “15 Big Ones” [the album immediately preceding “The Beach Boys Love You”]. And he wasn’t really entirely back. It was a big promotion that Mike (Love) put together with his brother, trying to make something out of nothing, quite honestly. Sahanaja : But the way you described how Brian put this music together and brought you guys in sort of in the late stage to sing on it, I don’t know why, but I see that as a very similar — maybe in a completely different context —to the way you did “Pet Sounds” [in the mid-‘60s]. Because in the same way, you guys were on tour, so it was very personal for Brian at the time. He put all the tracks together, and then the guys came into town and you laid down the tracks. I almost see that as a similar approach for Brian . And that’s why I consider “Love You” probably Brian’s second-most-personal album, after “Pet Sounds,” because basically, he wrote all the songs. I mean, even more personal in a way, because he wrote most of the lyrics. With “Pet Sounds,” he had Tony (Asher as lyricist), as you know. Jardine: Of course, Mike and I did write a couple songs, but they pale in comparison to his personal stuff. It’s just remarkable. And I admit I didn’t really appreciate it, because we were in the hit mode. We were on tour all the time. We were like, “We gotta have another hit. We gotta have another single.” And this wasn’t about that. Sahanaja : Well, that’s why Brian is an artist. He takes risks, he does things… If they fail, they fail. If they’re successful, they’re successful. Jardine: I mean, I don’t even remember singing some of this stuff. I don’t remember singing on “Solar System,” for instance. Sahanaja: You are in that vocal stack. Jardine: Am I? Are you sure? You would know. He (Sahanaja) knows how to pull this stuff out. But who writes a song with that kind of context, about the planets? t’s just beautiful. Sahanaja : Very sincere, very childlike. Jardine: You know, “Airplane.” Oh my God. “Airplane” is one of my favorites of all time.Now I’m completely… Sahanaja : Well, this was my favorite thing in the process of all this, is how he was skeptical at first, and just to watch him become reoriented with this music again and discovering it… maybe because the first time, it wasn’t successful, so onto the next… I love seeing him getting really, really into the music and realizing, “God, these are really, really beautiful songs.” And of course, in the wake of us losing Brian, it’s just his soul and his spirit are with us… Jardine: He’s right there. He’s right there. Sahanaja : That’s how we feel on stage. Every time we play these songs. I’m just like, ahhh, you can feel Brian’s soul. Al Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band at Cerritos Center Chris Willman/Variety Jardine: The guys in the band carry these leads really well, and do it justice. You carry Carl’s leads amazingly. How you do that? “God, please let us go on this way…” You won’t believe that, his performance, how he carries the spirit of Carl. Dennis (Wilson)… Sahanaja : I don’t do Dennis. “I Want to Pick You Up”… I can’t really sing that like Dennis. … To be fair, I’ve met people who maybe are not big fans of the record for one reason or another, but I would imagine a lot of it is because the way it’s executed is very raw… Jardine: Well, the amazing thing, it’s a synth-driven record, right? And your peers relate to that. Brian was in the forefront of all that stuff. He didn’t use bass guitars on this. He had a Moog synthesizer [as the bass]. It was a different style of production than the Beach Boys were accustomed to. And he literally brought that world to us, and so I’m sitting there with a guitar and going, “What the hell am I supposed to do?” So I really didn’t relate in that sense musically to it at first. Now I get it, because it’s so cleverly written. Sahanaja : With all the synths and really odd sort of production decision-making on it, I think it appealed to that next generation, especially going into the ‘80s and beyond, because it’s got that synth-pop thing going on. But, typical Brian: he wasn’t intellectualizing it at all. He wasn’t calculating it. He was like, “This sounds good to me and I could do this. I can just grab a keyboard and play these notes, and there it is. I’m happy.” But the way it all came together in that sort of DIY approach, little did he know… Jardine: But at the same time, he writes a song called “Roller Skating Child,” which is totally Beach Boys. That almost harkens back to the days. And “Honkin’ Down the Highway,” those two that are like that, I could relate to, and I sing the lead on (“Honkin’”). It just feels natural to me when you feel Brian’s.ability to go backwards and forwards, or retro and future. Amazing. I learned a new chord, by the way, the other day, in my book. Did you know there’s a sus4 in “Roller Skating Child”? Sahanaja : Is there? Jardine: That’s what it says. I found a little book in my stack of memorabilia called “The Beach Boys: Volume One.” It’s got all the songs that we wrote , and “The Beach Boys Love You” is in it, of all things. So, look at me. showing him some new chords. Sahanaja : I’ve gotta take a look.I’ll have to check that. Because Brian didn’t like sus; he didn’t like sustained chords. Jardine: Well, maybe the book’s wrong, then! Darian Sahanaja Scott Dudelson When you guys are playing the “Love You” songs now, have you rearranged it to fit in a little more with the other classic Beach Boys stuff that doesn’t sound anything like that, or are you trying to recreate the original synthy sounds? Sahanaja : It’s one thing is to say recreating. Another thing is just to embody the spirit and feel of the record, the original sensibilities of the record, which was Brian’s … It’s like when we do “Pet Sounds.” You can cut corners and simplify the chords and all that, but that’s not what Brian wrote, and that’s not what he came up with in the studio. So you can say, “Yeah, let’s get the exact paint-by-numbers thing,” but if you do paint by numbers but if it’s not done with the right feel and the spirit of it… Jardine: They nail it. This band, they nail it. Paul Von Mertens (multi-instrumentalist and musical director): I remember during “Pet Sounds” (on a tour performing that entire album), we would even debate in rehearsal … There’s a funny banjo entrance. You know, is that a mistake or intentional? “No, let’s keep it because it’s on there.” Sahanaja : And even one in this record. How about “Johnny Carson”? It’s so clearly a mistake. There’s this errant symbol crash that’s completely not (right), and we just love it, because, again, I picture Brian just going, “Pssssh, that’s it! That sounds great. Keep it .” Jardine: Well, how about in the third verse? Is it the third verse where he goes “da-da-da” and he does the resolve. Sahanaja : Yes, yes, you’re right. Jardine: And Bob (in the Pet Sounds Band) plays it just like it! He plays the mistake, perfectly. Sahanaja : I gives it an out-of-the-box feel. It’s just like, what? But when you listen back to even the golden-era Beach Boys recordings of Brian conducting the studio musicians (in the mid-‘60s), many times they’ll play something and say, “Is that right?” And Brian will go , “Yeah, that’s great. Just keep that,” because he just loves the vibe of it. Al Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band joined by Weird Al Yankovic and Eric Idle in concert in Cerritos, Calif, with Rob Bonfiglio. Scott Dudelson It feels like there might be different audiences coming to shows like this. There are some people coming who really just want to hear “The Beach Boys Love You.” And then at most of these shows, there will be people who don’t know the albu at all. Do you feel like there’s kinda like two audiences that you’re playing for? Jardine: Probably, I’m sure. Sahanaja : I don’t know. In the spirit of Brian Wilson, I like the idea that we just forge ahead and be bold. Von Mertens: I think that the idea is partly to bring the audience along with us. I can remember on the “Smile” tour, we were playing a festival in Belgium, and it was kind of drizzling on a soccer field, and there were beer stands encircling the entire field where the audience was. We hadn’t been playing “Smile” for very long. and we’re playing this outdoor festival and people are sliding around in the mud. And I remember the whole band — Jeff (Foskett) in particular — was like, “We can’t do ‘Smile.’ They’re gonna kill us! They’re gonna hate it.” And finally we just like bit the bullet and said, “OK, we’re gonna do it and we’re just gonna throw down like we always do.” When we finished the set, we left the stage and the audience was singing that soccer chant that they do that’s like an audio equivalent of a standing ovation. They were all going, “Ohhh-wayyyy-ooh,” and we were like, “OK. I guess, I guess it worked.” Sahanaja : Exactly. I always believe that if the material is really good and it’s performed well with love and care, it doesn’t matter if an audience is familiar with the music. I think they walk away feeling like, “Wow, that was really good.” Jardine: But I do like the first note of the show… It’s an anthem, “California Girls,” and as soon as you hit that first ding. Sahanaja : You’re making me sentimental because, because our dearly departed guitarist, Nick Walusko, I remember when I met him in 1983. And Nick would always say, “What Brian could do with just one note. Like the intro of ‘California Girls,’ listen, I know it’s one note, but it’s like a whole atmosphere in that one note.” And I totally understood that. How many members of the Brian Wilson Band have carried over to this band now? Jardine: There’s 12 on stage. All of us. Sahanaja : Almost everybody; one of us, Probyn (Gregory), couldn’t do this tour because he was out with “Weird Al” Yankovic on that incredible, successful tour. So we have another fellow filling in for him named Emeen Zarookian, who plays with Micky Dolenz. It’s been really fun. … Just to go back really quickly to the audiences: I love that this new music, us performing the “Love You” material, is just because of its kind of DIY approach in the synths, and we’re getting a lot of young people coming out to the shows, and freaking out. We just see them chanting and jamming along and jumping and up and down. It’s insane. It’s great, because I know what they’re excited about: Brian being Brian, which is somebody eccentric… Jardine: The big sing-along is a tune called “Ding Dang.” You know the album. It’s 52 seconds long, right? But it gets the audience; they go crazy immediately with the biggest reaction, and they start going “woo” with this, just carrying on like a bunch of kids. It’s really a childlike experience. We add a little extra, actually, at the end. We actually have a chord change now. We will surprise you with it.

The awards were handed out Friday night at UCLA’s Royce Hall, and to Oscar watchers provided insight into the Oscars race for best editing. The winners in best film drama editing and best film comedy/musical editing has gone on to match the best editing Oscar 17 times in the past 26 years.

The Netflix documentary is also nominated for an Oscar in the best documentary category. Popular on Variety Damian Rodriguez who won best edited documentary series for “Pee-wee as Himself” – Part One dedicated his win to team and Paul Reuben. Rodriguez said, “We wouldn’t be here without him. He was such an amazing artist, and he influenced so many people, including myself. I wish he was here.” On the TV side, “The Studio” and “The Pitt” won in their respective categories for best edited comedy and best edited drama. The ACE Eddies recognize outstanding editing in film, television, documentaries, shorts and digital content. Ang Lee received the ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award. Kim Larson & YouTube Will were honored with the ACE Visionary Award, and Film Editors Arthur Forney, ACE, and Robert Leighton were given ACE Career Achievement Awards. Lee dedicated his award to his go-to editor Tim Squyres. “When you give me this award, you actually give me it to Tim Squyres.” Lee shared how Squyres had cut all his movies except “Brokeback Mountain.” “He missed that one because I told him, after ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,’ I’m retiring, I said ‘I had enough.’ So he took another movie.” Lee said he had stuck with Squyres for over 35 years. Speaking about what editing means to Lee, he said, “It’s very hard to say, but let me put this way, my wife said, I can only do two things, right, making movies and cooking. So let me use cooking as a metaphor. Shooting is like buying groceries, and the real cooking is on the editing table. That’s how I feel about editing. I’ve feel I have this editing machine in my head when I’m making movies, every section, every setup, editing is at the center of my consciousness. Every working day I have to answer, hundreds of questions about what I want. The only reason I can give directions and put the whole movie together is because I have that editing table in my head.” Lee added, “We’re in a particularly difficult moment, challenging moment, in our life of cinema. But I do believe, as long as there is as long as there are moving images, there will be editors.” Erin Casper who won best edited short for “All The Empty Rooms” that goes into the bedrooms of children killed in US school shootings, dedicated her win to the victims and the families “who opened their doors to us and welcomed us into their sacred spaces of their child’s bedroom preserved just as it was since the last day they saw their child alive.” She went on to say, “The word gun is never mentioned in our film, and this was intentional on our part, because we’ve all grown so numb to this epidemic.” She said their goal was to center the humanity and “the life that was in these rooms.” “South Park’s” Twisted Christian episode won best edited animated series. During his acceptance speech, editor David List said, “It was especially gratifying to work on these last 10 episodes because Trey and Matt really, really went for it. They challenged the boundaries of censorship and how far all of us can exercise our First Amendment rights, whether it’s political commentary, mocking celebrity or that expertly timed fart joke.” He added, “Our freedom of speech should ultimately be protected and celebrated regardless of political party affiliation.” Full list of winners below.

Discovery Stirs Angst At CNN – Again FCC Approves Charter’s Merger With Cox Enterprises View All February 26, 2026 4:46pm Story Arc Mark Thompson Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York With Paramount emerging as the winning bidder for a potential deal for Warner Bros. Discovery , one of its prizes would be CNN . That has triggered a new level of consternation at the network, not just because of the ever-present worries about cutbacks at a time of consolidation, but that CNN would be under the same corporate umbrella as CBS. The broadcast network’s news division is undergoing a transformation since the David Ellison-run Skydance acquired Paramount last year. Related Stories News That’s All, Folks: Netflix Walks Away From Warner Bros., Refusing To Raise Offer News WBD’s David Zaslav Wishes Netflix Well, “Can’t Wait” To Start Working With Paramount “Despite all the speculation you’ve read during this process, I’d suggest that you don’t jump to conclusions about the future until we know more,” CNN’s chairman and CEO Mark Thompson wrote to employees Thursday. Watch on Deadline He added, “And secondly let’s not forget our duty to our audience. We’re still near the start of what is already an incredibly newsy year at home and abroad, one that will culminate with critical U.S. midterm elections and who knows what else. Let’s continue to focus on delivering the best possible journalism to the millions of people who rely on us all around the world.” CNN’s Jake Tapper reported Netflix’s withdrawal from the process on his show on Thursday afternoon, telling viewers, “We have some breaking news internationally that affects everybody I’m looking at right now in the studio.” Democrats already are seeking answers from Ellison on whether he made any guarantees to Donald Trump about changes to CNN, which has long been one of the president’s targets. There also are concerns about editorial direction at CNN. At CBS, Skydance committed to hiring an ombudsman to take complaints about its news coverage. A former head of a conservative think tank, Kenneth Weinstein , was hired in that role. Ellison later tapped Bari Weiss , founder of the center-right site The Free Press, to serve as editor in chief of CBS News. He attended Trump’s State of the Union address this week, as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the president’s allies. Under the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, CNN and other cable networks would have ultimately been spun off into a separate entity. But Paramount’s proposal calls for buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery, creating a media giant. Jim Acosta, the former CNN anchor and host who launched his own media venture, posted on X, “As I’ve been warning, America now has state-compromised media. When 60 Min or CNN is in trouble, we’re all in trouble. Trump has cracked the code in how to hurt the press. Free speech is now at risk. MAGA corporations must not control the news. Support independent media.” Thompson’s full note is below: Dear All, Many of you will have already heard and seen our reporting about today’s two significant pieces of news: first that the board of our parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has decided that Paramount Skydance’s offer to purchase WBD is now the best offer in front of them, and second that Netflix has decided not to increase its own latest offer. David Zaslav is holding a WBD Town Hall Friday to discuss the news – you should already have received an invitation to that. We will hold our own CNN Town Hall as soon as possible after that to discuss next steps and to answer your questions to the best of our ability. I want to end this note with two thoughts: Despite all the speculation you’ve read during this process, I’d suggest that you don’t jump to conclusions about the future until we know more. And secondly let’s not forget our duty to our audience. We’re still near the start of what is already an incredibly newsy year at home and abroad, one that will culminate with critical U.S. midterm elections and who knows what else.

The move comes two hours after Warner Bros. Discovery said it determined that the latest offer it received from Paramount was superior to the $82.7 billion deal it signed with Netflix on December 5. Related Stories News WBD’s David Zaslav Wishes Netflix Well, “Can’t Wait” To Start Working With Paramount News With Netflix Out, Cory Booker Calls For David Ellison To Testify On A Paramount-WBD Deal Netflix still had four business days to match Paramount’s offer but decided, why wait? Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters regretfully took the company out of the running, saying, “We’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.” Read a joint statement from the two executive below. Netflix investors are relieved, no regrets. The stock is up 10%. The drama began six month ago, and truth be told, Paramount was in there first as CEO David Ellison set his sights on Warner Bros Discovery almost immediately after closing the Skydance-Paramount merger in August. He began making rapid-fire offers , all rejected , pushing the WBD board to open things up with a formal auction process that resulted in four offers — from Paramount, Netflix, Comcast and one mystery bidder never specified. “This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.” — Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters WBD clinched a a deal to sell Warner Bros’.’ streaming and studio assets to Netflix, a major departure for the streamer that tends to grow organically. Paramount launched a hostile tender offer , threatened a proxy fight and things got noisy. It sweetened its offer several times but continually was rebuffed by WBD until this week. A seven-day negotiating window ended with a new offer that Warner felt was superior to the Netflix deal. Paramount raised its offer price to $31 a share in cash, from $30, but also addressed other concerns raised by the WBD including around financing guarantees. The two sides now are working on the text of a final agreement, which would need approval by WBD shareholders and a green light from regulators in the U.S. and other territories. Hollywood players, Wall Streeters, public interest groups guilds and lawmakers will know, definitively, where to direct their fire. Netflix issued this statement from its co-CEOs Sarandos and Peters: The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid. Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price. Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program. We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.

While there was agita over Netflix potentially crushing the theatrical window despite the streamer co-CEO Ted Sarandos promising a 45-day exclusive theatrical window (despite his actions in handling theatrical films in the past), the worry now is that Paramount won’t be able to keep its promise for 30 movies a year. The math doesn’t math out for many in the industry: How do you appease filmmakers and explain that their tentpole is following another tentpole on the calendar? There’s also the situation that 30 slots may not be available."

The companies unveiled their formal agreement on Friday. Paramount will hold a conference call and webcast on Monday at 8:30am ET to discuss the deal. Related Stories News David Zaslav Tries To Sell Paramount Deal To Shocked & Disappointed Employees At Town Hall: “We’re The Envy Of All Of The Industry” Executives Is Paramount’s Debt-Laden WBD Takeover Another Ill-Starred Hollywood Sequel? The formal announcement comes after WBD jilted Netflix, saying it received a Superior Proposal from the David Ellison company. Netflix had four days to match but declined immediately and walked away, leaving Par triumphant after a months-long hostile takeover attempt to pry apart its rivals. Paramount said the merged company is committed to producing a minimum of 30 theatrical films annually — 15 per studio per year. It promised film will receive a full theatrical release, with a minimum 45-day window globally and the current industry standard home video window prior to availability on subscription streaming services. Doubts around Netflix’s ultimate commitment to theatrical and intermediate windows was a major concern fo exhibitors and many in the Hollywood community. Watch on Deadline The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject regulatory clearances and approval by WBD shareholders, with a vote expected in the early spring. Paramount expects over $6 billion in cost synergies, short for cost savings. It cited a “combination of: technology integration (such as migrating the combined company to a single enterprise resource planning system and consolidating streaming technology stacks), corporate-wide efficiencies, including procurement savings, optimizing the combined real estate footprint, and otherwise streamlining operational efficiencies.” Many industry players anticipate thousands of layoffs. The transaction is funded by $47 billion in equity fully backed by the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners. At closing, the equity may include other strategic and financial partners. Paramount did not name them but its previous hostile tender offer included backing from the Public Investment Fund (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), L’imad Holding Company PJSC (Abu Dhabi) and Qatar Investment Authority (Qatar). Affinity Partners, the investment fund of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner , had also been involved but withdrew. Ditto for China’s Tencent. Under the terms of the equity commitments, new shares of Class B Paramount stock will be issued at a price of $16.02 per share. In addition to the new cash equity investment, the transaction is backed by $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo, which includes $15 billion to backstop WBD’s existing bridge facility and $39 billion of incremental new debt. The $54 billion excludes $3.5 billion of bridge financing from these institutions to backstop an existing $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. The combined company will own a film library of more than 15,000 titles and thousands of hours of television programming with franchises including Harry Potter , Mission Impossible , Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, the DC Universe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Transformers, Star Trek and SpongeBob SquarePants . Combined sports rights will include the NFL, Olympics, UFC, PGA Tour, NHL, Big Ten and Big 12 Football, NCAA College Basketball, and Champions League, with the ability to distribute these rights collectively across all of its platforms. The merged company will have a massive portfolio of cable networks. That will include CNN, to the alarm of some lawmakers and many in the news business given shifts at CBS since David Ellison acquired control. The new company will inherit a diverse international portfolio from the former Discovery Communications, present in over 200 countries and territories with cable and free-to-air networks. Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, has stressed technology and today’s announcement promised streamlining of “the technological underpinning of every aspect of the combined company’s businesses.” Paramount said it will be well-positioned to invest in growth, noting marquee deals since the Skydance merger with Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park , the UFC, the Duffer Brothers and Activision. However, Wall Streeters have noted it will carry a huge amount of debt that may constrain investment. “From the very beginning, our pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery has been guided by a clear purpose: to honor the legacy of two iconic companies while accelerating our vision of building a next-generation media and entertainment company. By bringing together these world-class studios, our complementary streaming platforms, and the extraordinary talent behind them, we will create even greater value for audiences, partners and shareholders — and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead,” said Paramount CEO David Ellison. “I’m very pleased with the outcome we achieved for WBD shareholders and the entertainment industry. Our guiding principle throughout this process has been to secure a transaction that maximizes the value of our iconic assets and our century-old studio while delivering as much certainty as possible for our investors. We look forward to working with Paramount to complete this historic transaction,” saoid WBD CEO David Zaslav . Is Par’s Debt-Laden WBD Takeover Another Ill-Starred Hollywood Sequel?

Despite Thompson’s message, the mood among many at the cable news network on Friday was “beyond bleak,” per one source. Related Stories News Massive Merger Confirmed: Paramount And WBD Reveal Details Of $110 Billion Deal News With Paramount As A Potential New Owner, CNN CEO Mark Thompson Urges Employees, “Don’t Jump To Conclusions About The Future” Paramount has yet to comment on its specific plans for the network after emerging as the winner for WBD , but in the months since Warner Bros Discovery put itself up for sale, there has been rampant speculation about what life will look like if the David Ellison-led company owned CNN. Watch on Deadline Fears only accelerated after the Wall Street Journal reported in December that Ellison made assurances to Trump that he would make major changes to the network, long a target of the president’s. Ellison’s appearance at Trump’s State of the Union address , as a guest of one of his most stalwart congressional supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), probably didn’t help soothe fears of the network’s future editorial direction. “There should be a lot of concern and consternation,” said Frank Sesno, professor at the George Washington School of Media and Public Affairs and former Washington bureau chief for CNN. When Sesno was at the network, he went through two mergers, when Time Warner acquired the network in 1995 and then when AOL bought Time Warner in 2000. Each time, he said, the question was whether corporate interests align and whether that values journalism. This time is different, he said. “Does CNN’s unique global presence matter?” Sesno said. “Given all the politics, and the sturm and drang around the Ellisons, and what we know and what was said, there is reason to be concerned.” As the bidding process was playing out last year, much of the D.C. consensus was that Paramount would emerge the winner, leaving the company with two major news organizations, CBS News and CNN. In the eyes of one veteran, that development could prove to be worse for CBS News than CNN, in part because the latter is heavily unionized, at a time when Paramount will be under pressure to massively reduce costs. Sesno said that the three major areas of concern are the editorial direction, how Paramount combines resources to save money, and the organizational structure. He said that most concerning are the political pressures, as “the Ellisons have made no pretense of being chums with Donald Trump and Donald Trump made no pretense of who he wanted to see victorious in this merger.” Yet Another Period Of Uncertainty CNN finds itself in yet another period of uncertainty, with its parent company already sold twice in the past decade. During his first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s purchase of CNN parent Time Warner, the companies sought to mount a defense of retaliation due to Trump’s hatred of the news network. The DOJ denied it, and the judge declined to allow such an argument. Although AT&T prevailed, the suspicion of Trump’s influence lingered. What’s different about Trump 2.0 is the extent to which efforts to lobby the president for favorable treatment are much more blatant. Trump himself had said that he would be involved in whether the deal gets regulatory approval, breaking from a presidential tradition of keeping arm’s length. Although he later said that he would leave it to the DOJ to decide, earlier this week he was demanding that Netflix fire Susan Rice , one of its board members. The anxiousness over the situation also stems from the way that Skydance’s purchase of Paramount Global went down last year. As they sought to get the deal through regulatory approval, the previous Paramount owners settled Trump’s lawsuit against CBS for $16 million, even though the litigation, over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, was seen by many legal experts as baseless. As it sought the FCC’s greenlight, Skydance committed to an ombudsman to take newsroom complaints. The new Paramount then hired Bari Weiss , founder of the center-right opinion site The Free Press, to take charge of the news division as editor in chief. A number of her changes outlined in her strategy have been directed at regaining a footing as viewer habits shift to streaming and social media, the same challenge that other legacy news outlets have tried to address. But Weiss also put a heavy emphasis on rebuilding trust, a problem that certainly bears out in polls. The Problem Of Trust Sesno said that he agrees that is a major problem for news organizations, not just those that may be perceived as leaning to the left but to those leaning to the right. Where he cautions is over the implication that “in order to build trust, you need to avert your gaze from holding everyone’s feet to the fire.” “We have a false equivalency here that creates confusion in the public’s mind and oversimplifies the problem and the challenge that confronts people seeking to do journalism in the way that it is meant to be done,” he said. The actions to address the problem of trust can in turn create plenty of consternation in news divisions: The assumption often is that it means a shift rightward, something that in turns triggers extra scrutiny from audiences on the left, who may be the more loyal viewers. As CBS News has laid off employees and offered buyouts, some have gone out with stinging rebukes of the new strategy. According to the Guardian , producer Mary Walsh, departing after 46 years this week, wrote to staffers that “maybe it’s for the best. We’ve been told to aim our reporting at a particular part of the political spectrum. Honestly, I don’t know how to do that.” In announcing the merger on Friday afternoon, Paramount’s release touted of being able to “offer complementary portfolio of cable networks spanning entertainment, sports and news will significantly improve cash flow, unlock efficiencies, and strengthen our ability to manage linear market pressures.” There were no specific commitments for CNN. “I’m very worried about the people there,” said Jim Acosta, the former CNN anchor and chief White House correspondent who left last year and launched his own media company. “From everything I hear many of the staffers at CNN work with perpetual job fear.

Tweeting the not-so quiet thing out loud today, Rob Bonta revealed he is in talks with other state (read Blue State) AGs about concerns they have on the absorption of WBD into the corporation owned by Donald Trump ‘s “good friends” David Ellison and his Oracle found father Larry Ellison.

Watch on Deadline Mark, I hear you. I’m in conversation with my AG colleagues about Paramount/Warner Bros. As the epicenter of the entertainment industry, California has a special interest in protecting competition. https://t.co/Av74BFnEsi — Rob Bonta (@AGRobBonta) February 27, 2026 As for Ruffalo himself, who has on more than one occasion ruffled a few feathers with his advocacy, red carpet label pins and outspokenness, the Hulk actor suggested to Bonta to put together a posse. “Please let’s circle up all the State AG’s and talk about how this is going to kill completion in the industry and drive down wages, and product quality for consumers,” Ruffalo posted last night after news of Netflix dropping out of the battle for WBD and Paramount’s 11th hour $110 billion hostile takeover bid getting the Warner’s board nod. “There are lots of agents in Hollywood who can tell you how past mergers and consolidations have hurt their clients and business. There is lots of talent that can tell you the same.” Having already put the brakes late Thursday on any victory laps by Ellison and that other David, WBD CEO David Zaslav in Paramount’s tentative win for all of WBD over Netflix with a stern “not a done deal,” Bonta is now emerging as the top interrogator of this latest Tinseltown Mother Boxes meld. The CA AG’s office didn’t get back to Deadline on what the status of those talks with other state AGs were and who was talking to who. However, sources in Sacramento tell me that it is pretty much the usual suspects of New York, Washington, Virginia and Pennsylvania at this point, with more on the go. Any attempt by state AGs to stop or slow down the Paramount and WBD meld would likely fit in to a competition and consolidation attack. Simply put, in the eyes of Blue State Justice Departments and maybe more, one big PARA-WBD would mean less places for filmmakers and producers to sell to and more power in the hands of one entity to set rates, prices and output. Without any irony on either side, that was pretty much the core of the claims MAGA and others made against Netflix when they were still aiming to buy WB. California Attorney General Rob Bonta at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 6, 2025 (Photo:Getty) As well as fellow Blue Staters, Bonta is also talking to Dems in DC in terms of strategic coordination. Certainly, that tracks with the fiery words Friday of the usually circumspect Sen, Chris Murphy (D-CT) that federal Democrats “are going to break up these anti-democratic information conglomerates” once they get the majority in Congress and in 2028 back in the White House. Sen. Murphy’s pointed remarks follow the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) throwing antitrust shade on Paramount talking over WBD and the role and influence of the CNN-hating Trump administration on the deal and the outcome. With MAGA plans to derail “woke” Netflix from scooping up the WB crown jewels a success, Red State AGs are mute now on their insistence of earlier this week that federal AG Pam Bondi dig deep into possible Sherman Act violations by the streamer. In that context, a February 20 launched monopoly and antitrust probe by the DOJ into Netflix seems moot now. Even before there was a WBD deal for them, Paramount a week ago announced that it had moved past a DOJ antitrust examination and the necessary waiting period. Additionally, moving things along nicely for PSKY for a deal that Zaslav says will close in a year, a March 4 hearing before the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, which roasted Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos earlier this month, has been canceled. That move by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) came as Sen. Booker unsuccessfully sought to have David Ellison show up to testify. The PARA-WBD deal as it stands, has some big baked in payout penalty fees, like the $2.8 billion Paramount already handed Netflix today and the $7 billion the Ellison-owned studio will have to give WBD if the deal fails its regulatory requirements. Also, adding up to millions and millions pretty quickly, there’s a daily “ticking fee” of $0.25 per share per quarter that starts taking effect on September 30, 2026 if the deal hasn’t been finalized by then. So, lots of moving pieces, and lots of AGs. Is Par’s Debt-Laden WBD Takeover Another Ill-Starred Hollywood Sequel?

Plus, Disney’s Asad Ayaz On Studio’s Oscar Hopes For 2025’s Biggest Movie – Notes On The Season View All February 27, 2026 3:56pm Getty Images A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit. Ballots are now in the hands — or laptops, actually — of the nearly 10,000 eligible voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and they have only this weekend and a few days after until March 5 to turn in their individual verdicts. That comes after a long season where the impact of the Oscar race has stretched out almost a full year if you consider that Sinners , with an all-time record 16 Oscar nominations , opened April 17, 2025, almost 11 months to the day of the 98th annual Academy Awards taking place on March 15, 2026. Then you had Cannes way back in May, when four of the five nominees for Best International Feature made their world premieres — including two Best Picture nominees in Sentimental Value and The Secret Agent , which between them represent 13 nominations overall. And then in June, Apple and Warner Bros unveiled F1 , another Best Picture nominee. Finally what is considered the “official” start of Oscar season came around with the fall-festival trifecta of Venice/Telluride/Toronto and the 6 1/2-month campaigns began in earnest. But don’t kid yourself, this has become a year-round adventure. Related Stories News Oscar Nominations 2026: ‘Sinners’ Leads With Record 16, ‘One Battle’ Next – The Complete List Below The Line 2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More So now it is all up to the voters, who have a new wrinkle in the process this year. They are supposed to swear under oath that they have seen all the movies they are voting on. Okay, that may be an exaggeration. AMPAS members don’t have to “swear under oath,” they simply have to attest to the fact that they have actually either viewed the nominees in a theater, in the Academy’s digital screening room (where technology can affirm the film was played, if not actually watched, by the voter in question), or have seen it by some other method. Essentially this is all on the honor system and was needed because it has become all too apparent that just a very few of those films eligible for Oscars in any given year are really being seen by large swaths of voters, and by extension don’t have a fighting chance of being nominated. The Television Academy has done this in various ways, also on the honor system, but in some years fortified with signed affidavits for each category. Watch on Deadline (Clockwise from top left) ‘Sinners’, ‘Hamnet’, ‘ One Battle After Another ‘ and ‘Sentimental Value’ Warner Bros./Focus Features/Neon This new system was developed to encourage members to watch the movies they are given the task of voting on. The trend has been fewer films dominating the nominations, and the numbers bear that out, indicating voters are only concentrating on a few titles. Excluding the three Short and Documentary Feature categories, there are a mere 30 film titles stretched over 20 categories this year out of 317 eligible feature films. Of that number, half of the 30 represent just a single nomination. If you eliminate Animated Feature and Makeup/Hairstyling, you would have just eight films with a single nom, making the gap even wider in 18 key categories. That means there are a mere 15 films that received more than one nomination, a strong indication, as has been true in the recent past, that a paltry number of movies are taking up most of the oxygen, a point proven just by looking at most categories and seeing the same few films listed over and over. What all this says is that in the democracy known as the Motion Picture Academy there are realistically few ways to break in and upset the apple cart. Unless you have a big campaign, or a distributor hell-bent on making a mark like Neon, which buys up every winner in Cannes and winds up with four of the five International Feature nominees, what chance do you have to get through to voters? In asking for transparency from its members, in hoping for honesty, the Academy is clearly aware this has become a contest for the haves and the have nots, and maybe, just maybe, by adding the intimidation level of “requiring” members to see the movies before voting it can begin to make a difference in the level playing field of the winners, and going forward the nominees. For now though it is just a few who will share the glory on Oscar night. And by the way, it is no wonder that David Ellison was so bound and determined to succeed in taking over Warner Bros. It is sad that Paramount, a once great player in this sandbox, has an embarrassing zero nominations (even with the shamefully under-seen Roofman , produced in part by the Academy’s current president Lynette Howell Taylor) while Warners has 30 noms and shares in another four for distributing Apple’s F1. If you can’t beat ’em, buy them. Salute To Oscar’s Underdogs – Class Of ’25 All of this brings me to the true underdogs who are hoping for a miracle come Oscar night, and counting on voters to see their films before sending in a ballot — those one-hit wonders, those single nominations that somehow overcame the odds and got recognition from their peers despite the fact they were in a movie that didn’t register with the Academy otherwise. Let’s look at the acting categories, where a whopping 11 of the 20 acting nominees come from only three films (count ’em, three films): One Battle After Another with four, Sentimental Value with four, and Sinners with three. The ‘Sentimental Value’ team in Cannes Getty The Academy smartly lets the individual branches vote for nominations, but in the finals taking place now until next Thursday, it is the entire Academy that gets to vote in every category (provided they verify they have seen the nominees — see the beginning of this column for details). That means those acting nominees coming from those three films with a combined total 38 nominations overall have a distinct advantage of being seen by all members, not just the branch that invited them to the party. And five of the other acting nominees are also in multi-nominated movies that have all been nominated in Best Picture, a huge advantage. So is there any hope, any hope at all , for those not in a Best Picture nominee and therefore tilting at windmills, climbing the highest mountain, trying to defeat the odds, but praying the new rule designed to make voters testify they see you really works? If it does, can we reasonably expect that Ethan Hawke , Kate Hudson , Rose Byrne and Amy Madigan have a fighting chance? ‘Blue Moon’ Berlin Film Festival Hawke has won widespread praise for his portrayal of musical genius Lorenz Hart in Blue Moon but his, along with Best Original Screenplay, is just one of two nominations for the movie from Sony Pictures Classics, which is not waging the kind of money-ed campaign going for the likes of DiCaprio, Chalamet, and Jordan in more widely seen movies than this terrific little indie. Hawke has, out of necessity, been out there stumping (check out my current The Actor’s Side video interview with him on Deadline), but is it enough? I have talked to voters who bring his name up voluntarily, a good sign, but how many have seen it? Kate Hudson and Hugh Jackman in Craig Brewer’s ‘Song Sung Blue’ Sarah Shatz/Focus Features Hudson, so great in Song Sung Blue, continues to get a robust campaign with billboards and TV ads from Focus Features. But she is up against front-runner Jessie Buckley in Hamnet getting even a bigger campaign from the same distributor, and Hudson is the sole nomination for her film, so its a long shot here. But never say never because 25 years exactly since her first nomination for Almost Famous there is a lot of hometown goodwill for her work. Facing the same odds, but not having nearly the kind of visible campaign support (ala TV, billboards, etc) from A24, Byrne is hoping to ride wins at the Golden Globes and Indie Spirits, as well as deep respect in the industry, to turn her first Best Actress nomination for If I Had Legs I’d Kick You into Oscar gold. It’s a tough assignment since it is the single recognition for the movie that premiered at Sundance 13 months ago, this despite the fact that her co-star Conan O’Brien is again hosting the Academy Awards. He, however, does not control which names are in the envelopes. Conan O’Brien and Rose Byrne in ‘If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’ A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection Finally, in the Supporting categories, every nominee except one out of the 10 is also in a more widely seen Best Picture nominee. That lone exception is veteran Amy Madigan, up for Supporting Actress in Weapons , its only nomination, and in the running again only 40 years since her first and only previous nomination for 1985’s Twice in a Lifetime. This achievement is close to a near record in term of gaps between nominations (Judd Hirsch still holds it at 42 years). The Critics Choice winner is looking for momentum from this weekend’s Actor Awards, but it is still a steep climb, not to mention Weapons being a horror movie and the kind of role that rarely wins Oscars. She’s brilliant in it, so again if voters watched she might have a fighting chance. Amy Madigan as Aunt Gladys in ‘Weapons’ Warner Bros. To give you an idea of the long odds facing these acting nominees in lesser-seen performances, Forest Whitaker was the last to take home Best Actor for a film’s single nomination, for Last King of Scotland in 2006. Julianne Moore in Still Alice was the last to do it in 2014 in the Best Actress category. Christopher Plummer pulled off the feat in 2013 for Beginners, and then before that it was Jack Palance in 1991’s City Slickers , 39 years after his first nomination for Shane. These were all veteran stars long overdue. In Supporting Actress, Penélope Cruz won as the sole nominee for her 2007 film Vicki Cristina Barcelona, but then Woody Allen films had a long track record of delivering in this category. Winning on a single nomination has become so rare that when Marisa Tomei did it for 1992’s My Cousin Vinny, a March release no less, it was considered even then so unlikely that a conspiracy theory lives on to this day suggesting that presenter Palance read off the wrong name. Still, there is always hope, especially with new guidelines urging voters to watch the movies, so best of luck to all of you. Oscar voting continues through March 5 at 5 p.m. PT.

Following Wednesday’s world premiere of Scream 7 , now playing in theaters, the actor told Deadline that despite reprising his role as Chad Meeks-Martin and starring in last year’s V-Day slasher Heart Eyes , the idea of being considered a ‘Scream King’ “stresses me out.” “I grew up with a certain affinity for horror and genre storytelling, and I feel like my natural proclivity to love stories, the Trojan horse sentimentality and themes through bombast and spectacle, is kind of what compels me as an audience member,” he explained. “And then as an artist, I feel like it allows certain stories that we tell as people to kind of transcend time or epoch and kind of resonate regardless of generation or experience.” Related Stories Red Carpet Premieres Kevin Williamson Comments On “Free Palestine” Protest At ‘Scream 7’ Premiere: “They Have The Right To Be Heard” Trailers ‘The Gates’ Trailer: James Van Der Beek Plays A Murderous Pastor In One Of His Final Roles Gooding added, “So, horror movies are something I love, and hopefully, I get to keep doing them for the rest of my life.

MASON GOODING: You know, I grew up with a certain affinity for horror and genre storytelling, and I feel like my natural proclivity to love stories, the Trojan horse sentimentality and themes through bombast and spectacle, is kind of what compels me as an audience member, and then as an artist. I feel like it allows certain stories that we tell as people to kind of transcend time or epoch and kind of resonate regardless of generation or experience, so horror movies are something I love, and hopefully, I get to keep doing them for the rest of my life. But the ‘Scream King’ moniker thing always stresses me out because I feel like there’s just so much more I wanna do. And I appreciate it, but I’m trying my best to live up to it. DEADLINE: That’s fair. I’m sure you heard about the protests last night. What was it like returning to this movie without Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega? GOODING: I think, in terms of engaging with something that began as a like meaningful family-oriented—in terms of the experience—project, that you hope that remains constant moving forward, obviously, you don’t know the likelihood of sequels. And getting to engage with the artistry of Melissa’s immense talent and Jenna’s incredible penchant for creativity, I’m grateful for the amount of time I got to spend with them in 5 and 6 . So, coming back for 7 , I think it felt like a natural process to go through a level of grief. And once they had discovered their story with Neve [Campbell] and Kevin [Williamson] coming back into it, I think after you process the change that takes place in a franchise as ubiquitous as Scream , my North Star kind of just became, how do I support these people that have created this world that means so much to me? And in an attempt to pay tribute to something that has been around since my birth, as I was born, I think a few days after Scream premiered, it was really just in discussions with them about how meaningful it would be to bring Neve and Sidney back into the fold in a way that I think was just very exciting for me. Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin in ‘Scream 7’ (2026) (Jessica Miglio/Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: And I also thought it was funny to see Chad and Mindy now as Gale’s “hot interns.” GOODING: Right, as we put it. The evolution of character became such a natural element to how you play the character. I loved that Chad had a level of exhaustion that I think is natural, given his experience in the past two films. And I think that juxtaposes nicely with Jasmin [Savoy Brown] portraying Mindy as still as passionate, as exuberant as she is, meaning that she will always be dedicated to her inquiry and pursuit of correctly guessing, or incorrectly guessing the nature of the film they’re in. But also, just for them, it’s real life, the lives that they lead. DEADLINE: I feel like both of them are practically invincible at this point. GOODING: See, it’s funny cause you do start to wonder what it is that coalesces into a kill in the Scream franchise. Obviously, Dewey has had his fair share of stabs, but it wasn’t until they did the old stab and pull up method that seemed to do him in. I’ve always wanted to die in a spectacular fashion in a movie. The closest I ever got was this movie I did called Fall , where I fell, and off-camera. Scream is a great opportunity to get murdered in a much more memorable way, but it hasn’t happened yet, so I’m just trying to figure out the best way to incorporate that in, somehow. Maybe, Chad has a brother, and I can play the brother, and then the brother dies. DEADLINE: Yeah, they’re triplets. GOODING: Yeah, exactly … But see, I’m a big text analysis nerd. I love the idea that Chad predicates a lot of his character and understanding on the protection of others. He’s the type of person to put his body on the line for the people that he cares about. DEADLINE: I heard that there’s already like talks about Scream 8 . GOODING: [Kevin Williamson] did say that. It’s funny, I think the first time I had engaged with even the idea of continuing, someone had asked Kevin, and he brought it up that on set, that you just start coming up with ideas , and I feel like I don’t have the foresight to think longterm like that. They obviously haven’t had any discussions with me, but I appreciate that in putting Kevin back in the driver’s seat, in a lot of ways, we have access to his line of thinking and how all-encompassing it is, how little threads can be laid in one movie and have that pay off in a sequel or in a long-standing franchise. So, I’m not surprised, but I am personally, especially cause I wasn’t a part of those conversations, I’m curious to know what about 7 piqued his interest to return to an 8 , aside from the obvious, being Isabel May’s incredible performance, but that’s certainly no surprise for her. She’s remarkable in all ways, so. Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin and Jasmin Savoy Brown as Mindy Meeks-Martin in ‘Scream 7’ (2026) (Jessica Miglio/Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: Yeah, she was a great choice for Sidney’s daughter GOODING: I thought so too. DEADLINE: And I know you also have The Gates coming up. What can you tell me about that? GOODING: The Gates , it takes place in Texas. It’s about these three Black boys that try to make their way to a party in the wee hours of the evening and take a shortcut through a gated community, end up witnessing a murder, and then are pursued through that gated community by the perpetrator of said murder, and are blamed for it throughout. Filming it, we shot in Catoosa, Oklahoma, which I never thought I’d spend much time there, but now I know it intimately. I feel like we had so many assets that made the film feel so meaningful on the day, that to share it with people is so exciting, especially given our willingness to navigate certain thematic elements, like a relationship to federal authority or even a spiritual authority, as the antagonist of the film, played by the late great James Van Der Beek, misappropriates and also weaponizes the concept of faith and belief in religion and community to sort of direct the ire of the entire community into these three Black men that have ultimately just been trying to navigate their way out of said community. But, it was super fun, four weeks of straight night shoots. It was a lot of trying your best to remain present and having someone as seasoned and giving and considerate as James to kind of lead that way and incite a lot of growth, at least in me as an artist, meant that even though I was tired every day, I still felt like I was being productive and educated on the nature of leading a film, and how to lead with grace and be considerate of all others as he does so effortlessly. DEADLINE: Well, I’m sorry for your loss. That one cut deep, really. GOODING: I know, truly, and my heart goes out to his family. I personally go back and forth on the way we engage in honoring, posthumously, an artist’s body of work, and to me, I don’t look beyond the fact that I was able to meet him and have an experience on set. That was as impactful and meaningful to me, that I can now engage and share with my understanding of James in his personhood, outside of his work, that has meant a lot, not only to me, but to all people fortunate enough to watch his work. I can say that his personhood is as remarkable and all-encompassing in its own right, which you always hope people are as wonderful as you think they are, and James was certainly that. James Van Der Beek in ‘The Gates’ (2026) (Sherwood Jones/Lionsgate /Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: That’s great to hear. I really enjoyed I Want Your Sex . Gregg Araki is my favorite director, so it’s just cool to see him back. GOODING: He’s got good taste. It’s funny that he has a penchant for visibility, not only of community, but also of lifestyle and taste. And I feel like his fan base is also so keen on seeing something expressed, whether through sexuality or the aesthetics of sex, in a way that feels like spectacle. If in a horror movie, you have these gruesome kills and these crazy killer masks and things, Greg predicates a lot of his aesthetic on the humanity and the humor and the awkwardness based around sexuality and what that might look like from a cerebral standpoint, and also how that might feel from a set design or character standpoint. It’s very cool. DEADLINE: Yeah, his entire aesthetic, from the beginning, has always just been so inspiring to me. You play Zap, who’s a very outspoken gay character, and I know you have a lot of gay fans. Was there a pressure for you to get it right for the gay fans? GOODING: Of course, trying to pay tribute to the queer community by actually expressing knowingness and understanding, both of the adversity experienced in real life, and how that might incite Zap’s confidence in his willingness to reject social etiquette, as his version of reclaiming his own agency. I feel as though my own personal experiences kind of become more manageable by portraying characters that have a level of confidence and that ingrained sense of community that I love about my queer friends and idols, that happened to make the most meaningful art, bred through that adversity, that I feel like portraying that self-assuredness. And he’s very fashion forward. There was a piece that Zap wears in the gallery that was made, customized specifically off the runway, that I was lucky enough to put on. And I feel like Zap, as it relates to his identity, is able to push the boundaries and to be outspoken because he knows in theory what it feels like to be othered, or in the worst case, unpersoned. And I love any opportunity to play a character that is separate from me, but one that I can investigate and do research on and understand as best that I can, and hopefully, I did a good job. You have to let me know. But he was certainly the pleasure of a lifetime. DEADLINE: Yeah, he was fun to watch, definitely. And I didn’t realize the last time we talked, this was a reunion for you and Olivia Wilde, which is crazy because I love Booksmart . What was it like working with her again after so many years? GOODING: Obviously, the dissimilarity between being directed by her and being technically a co-star of her is kind of getting to engage with her brilliance on multifacets. The fact that she has such a vision and a brain for direction and narrative allows her performance to take all that creativity and understanding of world-building and turn it into a laser beam of focus into a singular person or singular character. That meant following that lead was as challenging as you would want it to be, to feel productive. But she also subverts that by being so giving and communicative about process and character, and I feel like whether she’s acting or she’s directing, there’s always an opportunity to learn something from both in the way that she carries herself and also the way she discusses intent and process. It’s the reason I’m here today, certainly, and also something I benefited from greatly as her co-star. DEADLINE: It was great seeing both of you in that movie. Any chance there’s like a 10-year reunion Booksmart movie on the horizon? GOODING: I would love to do that. Obviously, as I said, it’s hard to think longterm about what creatively makes the most sense in terms of reinvestigating narrative in a sequel or in a franchise, but Booksmart is one of those things where, because it’s a high school narrative, I’m always fascinated to know who these kids become in their adult lives. And if there was a Booksmart 2 , any opportunity to watch Kaitlyn Dever or Beanie Feldstein step back into those characters would be exciting for me, or Billie Lourd as Gigi, that for me, would be very exciting. But if people watch it, I’m sure they’d make it happen. It just depends on what people want. Keith Powers, Algee Smith and Mason Gooding in ‘The Gates’ (2026) (Sherwood Jones/Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett Collection) DEADLINE: I would definitely go see it. I loved the first one. GOODING: You and me both. Be there opening night. I don’t even need to be in it. I would watch it 10 times. DEADLINE: And I know you have a few projects coming up. What can you tell me about 72 Hours ? GOODING: It’s a bachelor party comedy in which, I’m engaged and my best man, played by Marcello Hernandez, and my bachelor buddies, Ben Marshall, Kam [Patterson], we accidentally invite Kevin Hart, he plays the character Joe. Hijinks kind of ensues through the streets of Miami. It was definitely, funnily enough, despite that incredibly warm and goofy premise, it was maybe some of the most challenging work I’ve had to do, mostly just cause I don’t think I’m that funny. DEADLINE: No, I think you’re funny. GOODING: I appreciate you saying that cause I will take that compliment as much as I can, cause it makes me feel like hopefully I’m wrong. But in this case, getting to work opposite Kevin, who has a masterful handle over being a conduit for comedy or drama when need be, it meant that I didn’t need to be very funny, cause I could rely on Marcello, Ben or Kam to inundate the story with so many jokes, and I have my little drama corner over here. And then Kevin allowed himself to, by proxy of his talent, made himself the conduit to connect the two, so that you’re getting the funny as well as the sentimental moments that make the movie, in my mind, actually very poignant and thoughtful in a way that I’m really excited for people to see. DEADLINE: That’s awesome. You definitely have plenty of funny roles. Like I said, in I Want Your Sex , there’s just nonstop laughs with your dialogue. He’s very unhinged. I love it. GOODING: But that’s under the watchful eye of Gregg, who himself is so hilarious, just innately. It made the job super easy. DEADLINE: Your dad is also a great comedic actor. I read somewhere that you went to set with him once and then decided you’d rather go to college first instead of acting. Is that right? GOODING: I don’t know if it happened quite as succinctly as that, because then I would have maybe more direction in my adolescence. But I grew up on set and would try and parse out as much usable knowledge about the craft of acting, as well as the business, that when I went to college, I think my original intent was to study acting and be trained from a classical standpoint. And he—I hope he doesn’t mind me saying, he’s not here, and I haven’t spoken to him in a minute—but he was like, “I think you should go study something else. Being an actor means empathy for personhood and understanding of the human condition.” He’s like, “I don’t know if learning technique through a college course is going to yield that understanding.” He’s like, “I think you should experience a different curriculum that might broaden your understanding of people.” Hence, I studied psychology and writing, which ended up being super useful, because I was able to spot out and analyze the script in a way that’s helped me a ton in my professional life. And also psychology means I can be my own therapist. No! I can really understand the human condition from a more collegiate standpoint and understand why we are the way that we are. So, when I talk to a director about decisions or choices, it’s not necessarily based on a technique, but rather a textbook understanding of causality and why we are the way that we are, specifically through our adolescence experience. DEADLINE: I noticed that like in the times we’ve spoken, your answers are very well thought-out, and it really provides like interesting perspective that I appreciate. GOODING: Yeah. Obviously, I’m still formulating my understanding of our place in culture as artists, specifically as it relates to my hand in that, and I feel like what we owe outside of the work that is consumed by an audience is an understanding and thoughtful nature with the work that we put out. I try my best to have an opinion on the films that I make, and also the narratives and stories that they tell, so that when I’m discussing something that might mean a lot to people like Scream or Love, Victor , I feel like I’ve had maybe the most heartfelt interactions about that show. It’s not coming from a place—this is no offense to actors that will publicly tout, “oh, I needed the money, I took the job”—I feel like the reason I act is to engage with the innate desire for people to tell stories. … Otherwise, I don’t want an audience member who maybe responds so resoundingly to that work to feel as though it didn’t mean as much to me as it did to them, cause at that point, it’s like, you might as well AI me. Our opinions are what make us human. It’s what I think separates us as individuals, and also ironically, is what brings us together through discourse. It’s why I love when actors, performers, athletes discuss their work and they discuss their intent, because it allows the person to shine through in a way that is very meaningful to me.

Discovery took Paramount’s “superior” offer and Netflix pulled out, Paramount+ held a previously planned premiere screening for Taylor Sheridan ‘s new drama The Madison starring Michelle Pfeiffer. Symbolically, given the events of the past 24 hours, the Friday premiere was held at a favorite event place of future corporate sibling HBO, the San Vicente Bungalows, where the WBD streamer holds its Emmy parties as well as premiere screenings, including the one for House of the Dragon. Related Stories News Where to Watch All The 'Scream' Films: Streaming Guide News 'Tulsa King' Spinoff Starring Samuel L. Jackson Gets New Title After Moving Setting From NOLA To Frisco, TX; Taylor Sheridan Writing All Episodes The Madison screening was hosted by Paramount’s Direct to Consumer chair Cindy Holland who called the family drama an “unexpected, incisive and intimate” entry in the Taylor Sheridan universe. The series debuts the first three hours of its six-episode first season on March 14. As Deadline revealed , a six-episode second season is already in the can, with its release date TBD. Sheridan wrote every episode of both installments. Watch on Deadline Production on Season 2 of The Madison was wrapping when Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount Global was completed, with Holland and her team, led by Head of Originals Jane Wiseman, taking over Paramount+. While, as Holland said, “I cannot take credit for anything related to The Madison except my desire to support this series which I’m very proud of,” the show fits into the new regime strategy to expand into female-driven dramas to balance out Paramount+’s existing slate, including hit Taylor Sheridan series such as Landman and Tulsa King as well as the Star Trek franchise. Two high-profile recent commissions, Discretion , starring Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning, and Fear Not, headlined by Anne Hathaway, also both fall into the female-forward lane which involves stories and talent in front and behind the camera. In addition to a largely female cast led by Pfeiffer, The Madison has Christina Alexandra Voros as director, executive producer and cinematographer on all six episodes from Season 1. Holland called Sheridan “a very talented artist and a joy to work with.” In addition to his slate of ongoing series, he has three upcoming ones, The Madison and Yellowstone spinoff The Dutton Ranch for Paramount+ as well as fellow Yellowstone offshoot Marshals for CBS, which will stream next day on Paramount+. The prolific writer-producer remains based at Paramount until January 2029 when he moves to NBCUniversal . The news of his new deal made waves in October , putting a spotlight on his relationship with the post-merger Paramount Skydance leadership. Sheridan has received several Paramount+ renewals since and recently committed to writing all eight episodes of Tulsa King spinoff Frisco King starring Samuel L. Jackson. Under the new regime, Paramount+ is experimenting with release patterns beyond Paramount+’s traditional weekly episode debut or the binge model introduced by Netflix where Holland and Wiseman were key programming executives for many years. For instance, The Madison ‘s first season is being released in two weekly installments of three episodes each. The series, which follows New York City’s the Clyburns to the Madison River valley of central Montana, is produced by Paramount Television Studios, David C. Glasser’s 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. In addition to Sheridan, in her brief remarks, Holland acknowledged Glasser as well as “the incredible” Pfeiffer, who attended the screening. She reminiscent about seeing Pfeiffer in Scarface and Grease 2 when she was young. “But when I saw your performance in Dangerous Liaisons i n the theater, it was that day that I knew I wanted to support that kind of art, those kind of performances,” Holland added, addressing the Oscar-nominated actress. The Madison also stars Kurt Russell, Beau Garrett, Elle Chapman, Patrick J. Adams, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Kevin Zegers, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova, Matthew Fox and Will Arnett.

The directing duo, consisting of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett , recently described “how hard” they wanted to go with their version of the film, before ultimately departing the project to direct their vampire ballerina flick, Abigail (2024), with Christopher Landon temporarily stepping in for the pair. “We never read a draft of any version of Scream 7 that we were going to do because we had left to do Abigail before that,” noted Bettinelli-Olpin to Entertainment Weekly . “The thing that we had in our minds for Scream 7 was sort of like, ‘How hard can we go with this?’ It was the thing that we talked a lot about. For us, it was always this idea of, [if] Scream VI is like a secret feel-good movie, Scream 7 ‘s going to f*ck you up. That was as much as we ever got to.” Related Stories News Skeet Ulrich Says He Was Supposed To Return For ‘Scream 7’ Before Melissa Barrera’s Firing News Melissa Barrera Appears To React To ‘Scream 7’ Premiere Protest: “I See You” Gillett added, “Given that we expanded the sort of scope of the story by going to New York, the other thing that we had talked about — just Matt and I, by the way, it wasn’t a conversation with the writers — was, ‘How do you do the opposite for 7 ?’ Like, shrink it down and make it this like ultra-contained, almost continuous, like minute-to-minute thing. But outside of our own stupid idea, we weren’t privy to any plan beyond just, ‘There’s gonna be another one.'” Watch on Deadline Although they didn’t have specifics to share, Skeet Ulrich recently teased what was supposed to happen in Scream 7 with his murderous character Billy Loomis’ daughter Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera) and her sister Tara (Jenna Ortega) in the “really, really interesting” sequel, before Barrera was fired from the franchise . Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett attend the premiere of ‘Abigail’ on April 17, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Gilbert Flores/Variety “I’m not involved. I’m really excited though,” he said of Scream 7 . “I’m excited for [original Scream (1996) writer] Kevin Williamson to take the helm and to see what the mastermind of it all comes up with. I have no clue.” Ulrich added, “I used to know because part of coming back for five and six was being a part of seven. It was a three-picture arc for Billy Loomis, or the imagination of Billy Loomis in Melissa Barrera’s character’s head. But when all that went down with her, obviously you lose her and you lose what’s in her head.” Spyglass fired Barrera in November 2023 over her social media posts on the Israel-Hamas conflict and the “atrocities being committed against Palestinians,” explaining the company has “zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.” Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott in ‘Scream 7’ Paramount/Spyglass Following her ousting, Jenna Ortega also exited the franchise , later noting that the sequel “ was all kind of falling apart ” without Barrera to play its new ‘final girl’ Sam Carpenter. Director Christopher Landon dropped out of the project as well, citing “highly aggressive and really scary” death threats targeting his children . Neve Campbell was then brought back to reprise her role as OG ‘final girl’ Sidney Prescott in March 2024, with original Scream (1996) writer Williamson on board to direct. She previously sat out 2023’s Scream VI over the low pay offer. Is Par’s Debt-Laden WBD Takeover Another Ill-Starred Hollywood Sequel?

The 3x Oscar nominee recently explained why those kinds of projects “never felt right” until Shawn Levy ‘s Star Wars : Starfighter , which went into production last fall and is scheduled to premiere May 28, 2027 in theaters. “It was Shawn’s enthusiasm and his vision and the script,” Gosling told io9 . “And I just avoided these things because they never felt right. And I’m glad I did because I feel like, [similar to] a book like this, [it was] worth waiting for. And it is like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Related Stories News ‘Star Wars: Starfighter’ First Look: Shawn Levy Posts Ryan Gosling Image From Mediterranean Sea Set News ‘Star Wars: Starfighter’: Shawn Levy, Ryan Gosling Reveal Details & Premiere Date For New Film — Star Wars Celebration A standalone film outside the Skywalker saga, Starfighter is set five years after Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

Watch on Deadline Gosling previously praised the installment as “such a great story with great and original characters,” as well as “so much heart and adventure,” adding: “There is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn.” While the actor has played Ken in Barbie (2023) and starred alongside Harrison Ford in Blade Runner (2049), he’s yet to play the same character twice.

To Paramount By Not Raising Bid Cindy Holland Talks Taylor Sheridan’s “Unexpected & Intimate” New Paramount+ Series ‘The Madison’ David Zaslav Tries To Sell Paramount Deal To Shocked & Disappointed Employees At Town Hall: “We’re The Envy Of All Of The Industry” View All February 27, 2026 7:54pm Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters Netflix With Netflix employees still absorbing the news that the streamer won’t be buying Warner Bros. per the two companies’ December 5 agreement, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters held a brief town hall Friday morning. The 15-20-minute affair was moderated by Netflix Chief Communications Officer Dani Dudeck and did not include a Q&A section, sources said. In their remarks, Sarandos and Peters sounded confident about their decision t o walk away from Warner Bros. and explained their reasons. According to sources, they said that they had a number for the storied film and TV studio and knew what it had to be in order to make sense for the company. When the Warner Bros. Discovery board came back with the recommendation for the higher price offered by Paramount and asked Netflix to match it, the duo’s response was a quick no. Sarandos and Peters noted that they had done due diligence and didn’t feel like they needed to prolong the process if the number was above the threshold they had set.

Discovery Stirs Angst At CNN - Again In justifying their call, Sarandos and Peters used a version of the line they used in yesterday’s “thanks but no thanks” reply to WBD ‘s request for a higher bid, that acquiring Warner Bros. “was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.” They also touted a strong year ahead for Netflix and momentum through 2030, a milestone year the streamer had been building to. Sarandos and Peters went on to thank employees, including those who had spent the last month and a half working on integration that didn’t happen, and asked people to go carry on with their work. They may have showed restrain and discipline in walking away, but that does not mean that Sarandos and Peters were not disappointed by the outcome of the Warner Bros. sale. Sarandos, in particular, had made it clear how much he wanted the century-old studio. With Paramount’s hostile takeover efforts ramping up in the past couple of weeks, he went on a publicity tour, talking up Netflix’s cause in several interviews, and was in Washington D.C. for meetings about the Netflix-WB deal when news of WBD board’s recommendation came in Thursday afternoon. Like the Warner Bros. Discovery town hall , which was held an hour earlier this morning, the 9 AM PT Netflix one was scheduled last minute, after WBD Board’s Paramount “superior offer” declaration Thursday afternoon and Netflix’s pullout an hour and a half later. Incidentally, it was the second Netflix town hall this week; the streamer also held their regular quarterly town hall a couple of days ago, I hear. As for Netflix staff’s reaction to losing Warner Bros., it is said to be mixed, with people divided over the news but virtually all stunned by it. “The office was quiet yesterday,” one person said.

By Takanori Tsujimoto, written by Yuichiro Momose, starring Subaru Kimura, Shitaro Asanuma and Yusuke Shirai, the synopsis calls it “an immersive cinematic experience where the outcome lies in your hands. “Vote with or against your fellow movie-goers to determine how each battle unfolds in Japan’s first interactive anime film, where each film screening is uniquely shaped by its audience. Disputes are now settled through rap battles instead of violence using a special microphone known as the Hypnosis Mic. Lyrics delivered through the mic directly affect the human spirit, thereby eliminating the need for armed conflict. Six groups (Buster Bros!!!, Mad Trigger, Fling Posse, Matenro, Dotsuitare-Hompo, and Bad Ass Temple) from regions throughout Japan now compete to prove their strength in the Final Division Rap Battle, hosted by Kotonohatoh.
